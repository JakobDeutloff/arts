# Atmospheric profiles

# Atmospheric profiles are stored in an ArrayOfMatrix.
# It contains one matrix for each atmospheric state.
# Each matrix row corresponds to one pressure level. The
# meaning of the columns is:
# p[Pa]        T[K]         z[m]         H2O[VMR]	O3[VMR]

# Storage in an array of matrix is handy for Chevallier data, because

# Optional manual override of T and VMR perturbations

# If your input data contains extreme outliers, the lookup table will
# get unreasonably large. It is suggested that you instead set them
# manually here. The Chevallier 91L data (humidity set) contains
# temperature variations from -70 to +55 (K) and humidity variations from
# 0 to 6 (fractional units). This should be the reasonable range of
# atmospheric variability. You will get failures from individual jobs in
# the batch, that are outside this range.
