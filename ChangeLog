	* arts-0.0.8

	* Added workspace variable group Los and workspace variable los on
	Patrick's request. The declaration of Los is now in file
	workspace.h, but it could be moved somewhere else in the future.

	
	* arts-0.0.7

	* parser.cc:
	In void read_name(string& name, SourceText& text): Changed isalpha
	to isalnum, so that names may now also include numbers. 

	This was a request of Patrick. I don't remember if I had a good
	reason to allow only alphabetic characters and underscores. Let's
	just see if we get any problems with this.


	* arts-0.0.6

	* Quickly implemented NumericSet for Patrick

	* workspace.h:
	- Added Numeric_ in WsvGroup 
	- Changed N_WSV_GROUPS to 3
	- Added   Numeric dummy to class WorkSpace
	- Added
	  virtual operator Numeric*() { safety(); return NULL; };
	  in class WsvP

	* notes.txt
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	The last point above was missing in notes.txt. I have added it
	now. Sorry for that.  
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	* workspace.cc:
	- Added: wsv_group_names.push_back("Numeric");
	- Added:
 	  {
	  static WsvPointer<Numeric> p(&workspace.dummy);
	  wsv_data.push_back
	  (WsvRecord
	  ("dummy",
	  "This is just to test Numeric WSVs.",
	  Numeric_,
	  &p));
	  }

	* methods.cc:
	- Added:
	  md_data.push_back
	  ( MdRecord
	  ( NAME("NumericSet"),
	  DESCRIPTION("Sets a workspace variable of type Numeric to a value."),
	  OUTPUT(),
	  INPUT(),
	  GOUTPUT(Numeric_),
	  GINPUT(),
	  KEYWORDS("value"),
	  TYPES(num_)));

	* m_io.cc:
	- Added the implementation of NumericSet

	* arts-0.0.5

	* ARTS has now the following methods:
        AllAbsExample
	VectorWriteToFile
	MatrixWriteToFile
	VectorWriteToNamedFile
	MatrixWriteToNamedFile
	VectorReadFromFile
	MatrixReadFromFile

	which all do the obvious. Parsing and executing of methods seems
	to work, but yet has to be tested for a wider variety of
	methods. Also, the executor already checks if all input workspace
	data is present, before it executes a method.

	* Added some more HowTos in file src/notes.txt

	* arts-0.0.4
	* Now we can parse and execute specific and generic
  	methods. However, I want to re-structure the method lookup data
	(add explicit fields for generic I/O, so that a method can have
	both generic and specific I/O). So this commit is mainly to save
	the state of the work before I start with this complicated task.

	* arts-0.0.3.
	* Arts can now parse specific (i.e., not generic) methods. There
	so far is only a single method, AllAbsExample, which sets the
	absorption parameters.

	
	* arts-0.0.2.
	* make_md_h.cc: Added.
	* math_funcs.h: Added.
	* math_funcs.cc: Added. 
	* absorption.cc: Added. 

2000-03-14  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* This file contains  SAB 14.03.2000.

	* arts-0.0.1.
	* .cvsignore files added everywhere.
	* Started this file, the Arts history. ALWAYS add a note to this
	file, no matter how small your change. Also, always update the
	running version number. Newest change log entries first!
	  
	You can very easily add an entry with emacs by typing either M-x
	add-change-log-entry or C-x 4 a.
	  
	Remark about version numbers: Arts has a 3 digit version number,
	like for example Arts 1.2.3. For user releases the third digit is
	zero.  The first two digits are set in configure.in. Update these
	only when you cut a user release. In that case you also have to
	set the third digit to zero.  The third digit is set in
	src/version.cc. Always update this, no matter how small your
	change!
