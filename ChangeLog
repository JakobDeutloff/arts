	* arts-1-1-521

	* src/matpackII.{h,cc}: Added functions for sparse matrix operations;
	transposing, muliplication with full matrix and multiplication
	with sparse matrix.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Added function for testing sparse matrix 
	multiplication.

2003-04-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-520

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionTest): Made a quick hack to test an 
	integration assuming B to be linear in optiocal thickness, following
	Equation 9.16 in Rodgers' book (though I think the expression is 
	wrong).

	A first test showed no improvement at all!? I have to check the 
	details.

	* src/rte.cc (rte_step): For scalar case, introduced a variable for
	transmission to save some time and make the code clearer.

2003-04-02  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-519

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Put a new line shape in the
	complex refractivity, giving at least provisionary meaningful
	results for the Zeeman absorption. Full implementation to the level of
	testing the routines through control files is pending.

	* src/zeemanproperties.h: Updated accordingly.

	* src/test_zeemanproperties.cc: Updated accordingly.

	* arts-1-1-518
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdateSeq1D): Added this method. It 
	updates the radiation field sequentially. The function is at the 
	moment hardwired in *i_fieldIterate* but later on I will make an 
	agenda out of it so that you still have the possibilty to use 
	*i_fieldUpdate1D*.
	I have made a test calculation, which indicates that the convergence 
	behavior is much better. For most directions only three iterations 
	are needed. Only in close to limb directions we still need 11 
	iterations (probably the multiple scattering effect). The number of 
	iterations does not depend on the number of pressure levels !!!
	I took 12 pressure levels and 104 pressure levels and needed 
	exactly the same number of iterations for both cases.

	* src/methods.cc: Added *i_fieldUpdateSeq1D*.

2003-04-02  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-517

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Put Stefan and me as editors and created a
	table of authors. Take a look at the table and change if I got
	something wrong. I would have preferred to have this table on the
	first page, but the list of authors can eventually be long and I
	don't think that the table fit on the first page. This solution
	was a suggestion from Stefan to avoid the problem in how to order
	the author list. The author table is in alphabetical order. Please,
	keep the table updated and give comments if you don't like it.
	Feel free to give the table a nicer appearance.

	* src/methods.cc: Changed doc for ppath_stepGeometric to make clear
	that lmax=0 is the same as lmax<0.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Added a sub-section to discuss the
	role of atmospheric grids and the path step length. I was not very
	inspired and there is nothing that it is not discussed in my emails.

2003-04-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-516

	* src/xml_io.cc: Fixed bug reported by Nikolay. Precision was not set
	on output which caused Vector to be written with unsufficient
	decimals.

2003-04-01  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>
	
        * arts-1-1-515
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (convergence_flagAbs_BT): Implemented a 
	separate method for convergence test in brightness temperature
	units. The old method convergence_flagAbs is not modified.  
	The convergence criteria keyword epsilon can be set in BT units.  
	I used the function invrayjean to convert difference between
	radiance fields to brightness temperature. This is because 
	Planck is non-linear for small radiances

2003-03-31  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>
	
        * arts-1-1-514
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (convergence_flagAbs): The convergence 
	criteria keyword epsilon can be now set in brightness 
	temperature units. I used the function invplanck to convert
	radiance to brightness temperature. I had to add *f_grid* and 
	*f_index* as input to this method. 

	* src/methods.cc: Added f_grid and f_index as inputs to 
	convergence_flagAbs.

2003-03-31  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_euler): For zenith and nadir paths
	along the end faces, the refraction can turn the path out of the grid
	in a way not captured by do_gridcell_3d. Additional checks to handle
	this included.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): Same change as above (but 
	only for latitude).

2003-03-28  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-512

	* src/matpackII.cc: Added file to repository

2003-03-28  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-510

	* doc/uguide/uguide.tex: Added \FIXME command. Usage: \FIXME{Put
	your remark here.} This will typeset the remark in bold and add
	FIXME: in front of it.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Documentation for
	abs_scalar_gas_FieldCalc extended after comment from Sreerekha.

2003-03-27  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-509

	* src/Makefile.am: Added matpackII.cc everywhere that matpackII.h was
	listed. I am not sure how to do this correctly (if both files should
	be listed at more places, for example in test_linalg etc).

	* src/matpackI.h: Changed SparseMatrixView to SparseView and added
	SparseView and Sparse as friends for VectorView and Range.

	* src/matpackII.{h,cc}: Divided matpackII.h into to files and add fixed
	some bugs and added a function for multiplication with vectors.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Uncommented and altered test3 to fit the new sparse-
	matrix representation and functions.

	* src/binio.cc: Commented away the declarations of destructors. The
	compiler would otherwise complain about "redefinition of ..."

2003-03-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-508

	* autogen.sh: Don't redirect output of rm command. Prevents
	autogen.sh from running properly with plain bourne shell.

2003-03-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-507

	* src/binio.{cc,h}: Moved destructors for bin[io]stream from cc to
	header file to fix problem with gcc 3.0.

2003-03-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-506

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Bugfix :-)

2003-03-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-505

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: arts_groups_to_latex.sh and
	arts_methods_to_latex.sh where missing in distribution (make dist).
	Added to EXTRA_DIST.

2003-03-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-504
	
	* configure.in: Added check for dot tool from the graphviz package.

	* doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in: Generate dependency graphs if dot tool is
	available.

2003-03-20  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-503	
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D, i_fieldUpdate1D): Small bug fix.
	*l_step* was taken to be constant inside one ppath step.

2003-03-19  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-502
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Same modification as for the 
	1D function. I have tested the new *i_fieldUpdate1D* and the result 
	is improved significantly in Limb direction. 

2003-03-18  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-501
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Modified gaseous absorption
	coefficients calculation. In the first version I calculated the 
	coefficients for all grid points and interpolated the values inside
	the RT calculation. Now gaseous absorption is calculated inside the
	RT part using interpolated pressure, temperature and VMR. This 
	reduces interpolation errors significantly. 
	Attention: Extinction matrix and absorption vector have to be
	initialized also in *opt_prop_part_agenda* (You should put  
	ext_matInit and abs_vecInit in this agenda, otherwise you will get
	an error message). 
	This modification will be implemented in 3D later.

2003-03-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-500

	* src/matpack{III,IV,V,VI,VII}.h: Removed inline keyword from copy
	function declarations. Because they are implemented in the cc file,
	they could not be inlined which leads to linker errors with -O3 and
	higher.

	* src/bofstream.cc: Removed output operator template.
	
	* src/refraction.cc: Added cmath include.

2003-03-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-499

	* src/bifstream.h, src/bofstream.h: Implemented putRaw/getRaw. 

	* src/binio.{cc,h}: Added pure virtual functions putRaw to binostream
	and getRaw to binistream. Modified writeFloat/readFloat to
	use putRaw/getRaw. Raw reading/writing is used instead of the byte-wise
	conversion-enabled routines when the data type size and endianness of
	the host machine matches the data file. Increases speed on pcs by 3.5.

2003-03-17  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-498

	* src/sensor.cc: Added antenna_diagram_gaussian that sets up an
	gaussian antenna diagram for a certain frequency. Also added
	scale_antenna_diagram that scales the diagram to match another
	frequency.

2003-03-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-497

	* src/binio.{h,cc}: Added. Contains classes for writing binary files
	including float/double, little-endian/big-endian and
	ieee-float/non-ieee-float conversions.

	* src/bifstream.{h,cc}, src/bofstream.{h,cc}: Make use of binio.
	bof/bifstream now use multiple inheritance. They inherit the file
	handling abilities from fstream and the architecture independent
	reading/writing features from binistream/binostream.
	Binio is quite dumb when no conversion for saving in the desired
	format is needed. This leads to drawbacks concerning speed. They
	will be extirpated in the next version.
	Note on current binary format: All float values are stored as
	IEEE-754 double precision. Integers are saved as 8 byte values.
	Byte order is always little endian (PC).

	* src/Makefile.am: Added binio.{h,cc}.

	* doc/index.html.in: Removed out-dated example files list.  Instead
	added a link to the examples directory.

2003-03-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-496

	* doc/doxygen/html/Makefile.am: Include png images.

2003-03-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-495

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Changed the author list, to only include
	persons that have contributed to the present version of AUG. As Claudia
	took the step and broke the alphabetical order, I also moved the 
	names around with the idea that the author list shall reflect the
	contribution to the user guide. As a pure coincidence my name ended
	up first! 

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Included control file examples.
	Fixed some smaller things that I discovered when working on the 
	progress report. Commented out figure on spherical/ellipsiodal
	geoid. The figure is not correct.

2003-03-10  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-494
	
	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Added Section about the absorption
	lookup table.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs: Renamed to symbol_defs.tex.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: What used to be symbol_defs.

	* doc/uguide/uguide.tex: Fixed the "destination with the same
	identifier has been already used" warning. (At least mostly.) The
	warning comes from incompatibilities of hyperref with other
	packages.  Remaining problem: Algorithm and hyperref do not seem
	to agree very well. But I managed to remover all warnings except
	two.

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Fixed the "destination with the same
	identifier has been already used" warning. All package includes
	are now in uguide.tex!

2003-03-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-493

	* doc/index.html.in: Removed link to ps uguide.

2003-03-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-492

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Updated author list.
	
2003-03-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-491

	* src/xml_io.cc: Cleanup.
	Added check for matching frequency dimensions in f_grid and
	pha_mat_data.

	* src/xml_io_private.h: Cleanup.

2003-03-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-490

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Completed description of Euler scheme for 
	refraction. Added 3 new figures, showing properties of the refractive
	index.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): The bugs mentioned in last 
	commit, were no bugs. It was late and I forgot that the scaling is
	performed as part of the functions returning the gradients of the 
	refractive index. The idea is that the gradient in all directions shall
	have the same unit (the change of refractive index over 1 m). 

2003-03-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-489

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Continued writing on refrcation. 1D and 2D
	finished. Must check expressions for 3D. I have missed some scaling
	terms. Added a figure: euler.pdf

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_euler): There was an inconsistency
	regarding the values used to adjust LOS angles. Radius, lat and lon
	were taken from the start of the ray tracing step, while za and aa
	were taken from the end point.

	There are similar mistakes as for 2D mentioned below, and for the
	moment there will be an error if you attempt to use this function.

	(raytrace_2d_linear_euler): The division with the radius was missing
	for the term including the latitude gradient of the refractive index.

2003-03-07  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-488	
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Same bug fix as for 
	(i_fieldUpdate1D).
	
2003-03-07  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>
	
	* arts-1-1-487

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Fixed a bug. The function did 
	not work when *ppath_step_agenda* putted extra points inside one 
	layer (this can happen when you specify *lmax* or when you cross the
	tangent point). Now the radiative transfer calculation is done by
	going from one point to the next inside one layer. 

	* src/workspace.cc: Included variable *single_scattering_data*.
	
2003-03-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-486
	
	* src/xml_io.cc: Implemented reading/writing routines for

2003-03-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-482

	* src/rte.cc (ground_specular_los): Removed an if-statement by
	instead using sign to seperate the cases of positive and negative
	zenith angles for 2D.

	* doc/uguide/introduction.tex: Removed some points in the the to
	do list :-) , but there are still many things to fix :-( 

	* doc/uguide/Figs/ppath/mkfigs_ppath.m: Created this file to generate 
	figures to visualize the calculation of propagation paths.

	Copied figures (with sligh editing) from ARTS-1 for Snells' law
	for a spherical symmetry.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Included the figures mentioned above and 
	polished the old text. Started to write about refraction.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/fm_definitions/mkfigs_ppath_cases.m: Recreated old
	figure for ground reflections.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Improved text for ground reflections.

2003-03-06  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-481

	* src/m_sensor.cc Remove the old test WSM SensorIntegrationVector
		and add a new AntennaTransferMatrix.
    
	* src/sensor.{cc,h} Added function antenna_transfer_matrix that
		uses sensor_integration_vector to build up a matrix that covers
		both frequency and mblocks. Both antenna_transfer_matrix and
		sensor_integration_vector has been tested for a simple linear case.

2003-03-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

2003-03-06  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-478
	
	* src/optproperties.{cc,h}: Created these files. Defined the new
	structure *SingleScatteringData* in optproperties.h. The functions
	concerning the transformation from the data to the relevant 
	workspace variables will be put in optproperties.cc.

2003-03-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-477

	* src/make_auto_wsv_h.cc: Removed touch member function from WorkSpace.

	* src/agenda_class.h: Removed touch member function from MRecord.

	* src/m_ignore.h: Fixed unused parameter warning.

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc: If parameter ws or mr is unused then omit

2003-03-06  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-475

	* src/m_ignore.h (Ignore): Managed to suppress the unused
	parameter warning for parameter *in* with a somewhat nasty
	hack. But it works, and I made sure that there are some explantory
	comments why this is done. Oliver, I believe the same trick could
	be used to make a template function "touch" that works for any
	type. What do you think?

2003-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-474

	* doc/uguide/los1d.tex: Removed this file.

	a compendium I have written (originally from a old report).

	* doc/uguide/sensor.tex: Commented out all old text. 

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Activated sensor chapter, and added chapter
	on radiative transfer theory.

2003-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-473

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Improved and updated text.
	Added two figures (ppath_badcases.pdf and atm_dim_3dcross.pdf).

	Check out the figures of the chapter (except from last page).
	I think they are nice (of course).

2003-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-472

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Included figure for 3D atmosphere 
	and modified figure text for 1D and 2D atmospheres.

	* src/XXXX: Fixed warnings about unused variables in "my" parts.
	
	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexUnit): Removed input arguments not 
	used. The function must now be combined by Ignore calls.

2003-03-05  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-471

	* src/m_ignore.h (Ignore): Issue a level 2 message which WSV is
	ignored. This avoids the unused parameter warning for *inname*.
	However, there still is one for *in*. Don't know how to fix this
	right now.

	* src/m_copy.h (Copy): Removed call of CloneSize.

2003-03-05  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-470

	* src/m_clonesize.cc: Added some level 2 and 3 output messages to
	surpress most unused parameter warnings. 

	* src/methods.h (MdRecord operator=(const MdRecord& m)): Added
	output of m to suppress unused parameter warning. 

2003-03-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-469

	* configure.in: Don't use -Wno-unused (gcc2) and
	-Wno-unused-parameter (gcc3) any longer.
	Removed check for gcc version.

	* src/agenda_class.h: Added dummy method touch to MRecord.

	* src/make_auto_wsv_h.cc: Added dummy method touch to WorkSpace.

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc: If WorkSpace is not used in method call
	ws.touch to avoid unused parameter warning.
	Same for MRecord.

2003-03-04  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-468

	* doc/uguide/Figs/fm_definitions/mkfigs_atm_dims.m: Modified
	this function. It now uses atmlab/arts/arts_plot_atmgrids.m.

	* src/ppath.cc: Removed input argument t_field as it was no longer
	used.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ZaSatOccultation): As above.

	* arts-1-1-466

	* src/m_ppath.cc (DoGridcell2D/3D): Removed these WSM. 
	(ppathCalcTest): Removed also this WSM.
	
	* doc/uguide/Figs: Created the folder concept and moved two
	figures to that folder. Removed all remaining figures in the folder
	/Figs (as decided some time ago). If you want to use some of the
	removed figures, copy it from arts-1.

	The decision is that all figures shall be placed in sub-folders,
	one fore each chapter, where the folder name shall match the name of
	the Latex file.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (Extract): Calculate number density with
	the physics_funcs function number_density.
	(Extract): Fixed bug reported by Patrick: VMR scaling for the case
	with temperature variations was missing.
	(Extract): Fixed bug related to pressure interpolation for the
	variable T case.

2003-02-28  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-464

	* src/sensor.cc (sensor_integration_vector): Added file and created 
	function that calculates the (row) vector that multiplied with an 
	unknown (column) vector approximates the integral of products between 
	two functions, where the two vectors are the quantizied representation
	of the functions. See ARTS 1 User Guide, chapter 7 Sensor modelling 
	for an in-depths explanation.

	* src/sensor.h: Added the file.

	* src/describe.h: Added line; #include "mystring.h". We need it for
	the compilation.

2003-02-27  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-463

	* src/rte.cc (get_radiative_background): Fixed a bug for cases with
	ground reflection. Bug reported by Sreerekha. The bug had no effect
	for a blackbody ground.

	The solution with agendas makes some things difficult. My solution
	for ground reflections involve a recursive call of RteCalc. The
	output from get_radiative_background is the WSV i_rte. When
	calling RteCalc recursively, I did this with a local variable,
	but RteCalc calls rte_agenda which will change the value of i_rte.
	The problem was that i_rte already contained interesting values.
	So I got a side effect from the agenda that I missed. I hope that
	there are now no such side effects left in this part. But changes
	for the agendas can easily affect this part, so we ahve to be careful
	when changing things for the agendas.

2003-02-27  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-462

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc: I'm still working on the gas absorption
	lookup table. Beware! This is not yet the final version. I want to
	do some tests tomorrow, in order to see if temperature
	interpolation works. The case without temperature variations is
	tested and is believed to work correctly.
	IMPORTANT: We are now storing absorption cross-sections, rather
	than absorption coefficients in the table. Old tables will not
	work anymore, unfortunately. However, this is worth the
	inconvenience since it decreases interpolation error by two orders
	of magnitude! (See my email to arts-dev.)

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Updated.

	* src/m_absorption.cc (abs_scalar_gas_fieldCalc): This method now
	takes f_index as input. Depending on f_index, the field will be
	calculated for all frequencies, or just for one frequency.

	* src/methods.cc: Updated record for abs_scalar_gas_fieldCalc.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Added f_index in the input
	list of scalar_gas_absorption_agenda.

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_from_stream): Read .xml instead of .abs.
	(xml_write_to_stream): Write .xml instead of .abs.

	* src/describe.cc: Added. This file contains a set of helper
	functions called \c describe, which you can use to output the
	dimensions of a tensor. This is just for testing purposes.

	* src/describe.h: Added. Header file for describe.cc.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Modified some tests.

	* src/matpackIII.cc: Only linebreak changes.

	* src/matpackI.h: Only whitespace removed.

	* src/matpackI.cc: Only indentation changes.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Updated copyright notice.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Updated copyright notice.

	* src/Makefile.am (test_matpack_SOURCES): Added describe.

	* arts-1-1-461
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (convergence_flagAbs): Modified the function. It
	has been a very special function for the radiation field. Now it is a 
	general method which can be used for any Tensor6's.
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D), (i_fieldUpdate3D): Structured
	the interface variables such that it is easier to see why they 
	are needed in the function. 
	Also removed some variables:
	There was a diskussion about *stokes_dim* and *atmosphere_dim* 
	some time ago. I removed this variables now and extracted the 
	dimensions from other variables.
	Furthermore I could remove some variables which had been used for
	executing *scat_rte_agenda* which is not there anymore. We decided
	to "hardwire" the RT method to be used.

	* src/m_scatrte (i_fieldIterate): Structured interface variables.

	* src/m_scatrte (ScatteringInit): Created this function to initialize 
	the variables used in agendas for scattering calculations. Previously
	the initialization was done in *i_fieldIterate*. The structure becomes
	clearer when we have this additional function.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (iteration_counterIncrease): Icluded this small
	function to be able to separate the iteration counter from the other
	methods (for modularity reasons).
	
	* src/methods.cc: Adjusted entries according to changes above.

	* src/agendas.cc: Modified input/output for *opt_prop_part_agenda* and
	*convergence_test_agenda*.

	* doc/examples/cloud_rad_field1D_example.arts.in: Added more desciption
	into the controfile to make clear, where which agenda is used.

2003-02-24  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-458

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): Removed a variable not used (with
	apossible size of up to 10 Mb!) and moved some lines to outside a
	for loop (to maybe save some time).

2003-02-23  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-457

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Further work on documentation of the path
	calculations. Geometrical paths are close to be finished. Some
	details are missing. I plan also to create some figures.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Added definition of the azimuth angle
	at the poles.

2003-02-17  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-456

	* src/main.cc: Set default reporting level for report file to 0. My

	use report level 3.

2003-02-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-455

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Text added to describe the calculation of

2003-02-11  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-454

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Modified existing text as a first step to

2003-02-11  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-453

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ZaSatOccultation): Created WSM for calculating
    zenith angles during satellite occultations.

	* src/ppath.h (geompath_lat_at_za): Added method to header file.

2003-02-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-452

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxSetManually): The function now behaves as
	expected for limits identical to grid values.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Improvement in 1-1-451 for west-east
	cases was incorrect. In the hurry, the type for abs( aa_start ) was
	set to bool (instead of double). This turned the fix off, and there
	was a crash for Numeric=float. It appears that this fix is not needed
	for double, but I leave it, just in case.

2003-02-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>
	
	* arts-1-1-451

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Upward observations along
	the upper latitude limit is not allowed for 2D. That is, start position
	inside the atmosphere, za=0, and lat=last(lat_grid).

	(do_gridcell_3d): Test for finding strictly west-east
	observations was wrong. Strange that it has not crashed. All old
	3D results are definitely wrong.  

2003-02-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-450

	* src/ppath.cc (geompath_from_r1_to_r2): Using r2 instead of r[n]
	when calculating za[n], as r2 is always double. The conversion from
	double top float can result in a shift of 0.1 m, which can end up
	below ppc.

	Successful tests with refraction and Numeric=float for 1D and 2D.
	So, refraction for 1D and 2D is now hopefully working (3D with
	refrcation is NOT worling yet).

2003-02-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-449

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Introduced an allowed tolerance
	for latitudes and longitudes (LATLONTOL). This turned out to be
	necessary when using very fine pressure grids (the test was
	performed with a vertical step size of about 15 m). This problem
	was reported by Claudia.

2003-02-04  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-448

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Fixed another bug in the calculation of the
	relative intensities of individual Zeeman components.

2003-02-04  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-447

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): I discovered that calculations from
	CloudboxGetIncoming with azimuth angles of exactly 90 degrees caused
	problems (at least for Numeric=float). Some special checks are now
	introduced for this case to avoid that the positions are shifted
	incorrectly to south or north for short step lengths (<1m).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Removed some crap output
	to the screen.

2003-02-04  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-446

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Fixed a bug in the calculation of the
	relative intensities of individual Zeeman components. Added two
	more output variables in order to save the frequencies and the
	corresponding relative intensities of the components as matrixes
	in xml format.

	* src/zeemanproperties.h: Modified the file according the changes
	in the zeemanproperties.cc.

	* src/test_zeemanproperties.cc: Modified the file according the changes
	in the zeemanproperties.cc.

2003-02-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-445

	* src/Makefile.am: Added m_xml.cc to arts_SOURCES.

	* src/test_binaryio.cc: Updated.

	* src/m_xml.h: Rename FType to FileType and FTYPE_{ASCII,BINARY} to
	FILE_TYPE_{ASCII,BINARY}.
	WriteXML gets file_format as input.
	Added output_file_formatSet{Ascii,Binary}.

	* src/m_xml.cc: Added.

	* src/xml_io.cc: Renamed FType to FileType and FTYPE_{ASCII,BINARY} to
	FILE_TYPE_{ASCII,BINARY}.
	(xml_read_header_from_stream): Read endian type and
	numeric type from input file.

	* src/xml_io.h, src/xml_io_private.h: Rename FType to FileType.

	* src/methods.cc: Added output_file_formatSet{Ascii,Binary}.
	WriteXML gets output_file_format as input.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added variable output_file_format.
	
	* src/.cvsignore: Added *.swp to ignore vim temporary files.

2003-02-04  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-444

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridrange_1d and do_gridcell_2d): Same correction
	as for 3D in last commit.
	
	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_crossing_2d): Some upward cases were handled
	incorrectly. Fixed bug for c=0.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): The entrance point for negative
	zenith angles and the sensor outisde the atmosphere was calculated
	wrongly.

2003-02-03  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-443

	* m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Modified. The distinction between
	uplooking and downlooking cases is now done using the grid positions
	returned by the ppath_step_agenda instead of viewing directions (like
	in i_fieldUpdata3D). Now, also viewing directions close to 90° can be
	handled. Interpolation in altitude is done logarithmically (was linear
	before).

	* m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Fixed 1D part. Didn't work 
	after some modifications for the 3D part.

2003-02-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-442

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Had to introduce a correction in
	radius to handle Numeric=float as points can end up slightly
	outside the grid cell (up to 1 m for float). 

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_crossing_3d): This function handles now
	only surfaces with slope. Moved code from gridcell_crossing_3d to
	this function and removed gridcell_crossing_3d.

2003-02-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-441

	* src/ppath.cc: Started to remove code not used. Introduced the
	file-common variables DEV0AND180 and POLELAT to make the accuracy 
	tuning more transperant.

2003-02-03  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-440

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Included *scat_lat_index* and
	*scat_lon_index* required for optical properties calculation. Before 
	the optical properties were only calculated for *scat_lat_index* and 
	*scat_lon_index* equal 0.

	* src/methods.cc(i_fieldUpdate3D): Modified according to correction. 
	
2003-02-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-439

	* src/ppath.cc: I found more new numerical problems with Numeric=float.
	This time for calculations with refrcation. It turned out that step
	lengths of e.g. 1 km could not be used. Decided then to test to
	hard-code double as far as possible in the function. Everything
	compiles without warnings. Not yet checked if things work better for
	Numeric=float.

	* src/math_funcs.h: Removed declaration of non-existing return version
	of function of type linspace.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (VectorNLogSpace): Not using removed return
	version of nlogspace.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (nlinspace): The last value is now set to be stop
	exactly (not start + i*strep). 

	Removed old return version of nlogspace.

2003-02-02  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-438

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_slope_3d): Applied bigger disturbance for
	float.
	
	(do_gridcell_2d): Upper pressure surface is now checked even if start
	point is on top of that surface. This is needed for tilted surfaces.

	(psurface_crossing_2d): Included a threshold for r0=rp.

	* src/ppath.cc: Smaller fixes here and there.
	
2003-01-28  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-437

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_try): Added ground intersections and
	some checks to handle paths along lon grid value.

2003-01-28  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-436
	
	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_try): I have worked on another scheme
	for this function. The new scheme is based on testing different step
	lengths, in a hopefully intelegent way, and simply test if the end
	point is inside or outside the grid cell. This scheme is slower than
	using a pure analytical solution, but it allows to compensate for
	numerical problems with float, and works for tilted pressure surfaces,
	So, if this is a success, both my present problems are solved. 

	I am now trying to stress the new scheme to make it 100% safe. 
	You will not use this new scheme when you compile. 

2003-01-28  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Fixed several bugs.

 	* arts-1-1-434	
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (ScatteringMain): Removed clearsky field 
	calculation on boundary (CloudboxGetIncoming) from this function.
	Now it is possible to read a pre-calculated clearsky field. This 
	makes sense as we are interested to test clouds with different
	particle types. For those cases the clearsky field on the cloudbox
	boundary is always the same and it saves a lot of time not 
	recalculating the clearsky field for each case.
	To do a convergence test it is now also possible to take an unrealistic
	field on the cloudbox boundary.
		
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Fixed a small bug.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetConst): Modified. This function is
	tested now and works correctly.

	* src/methods.cc (ScatteringMain): Modified interface variables.

	Note: I have made a 3D convergence test (in analogy to 
	the 1D convergence
	test). It works, so we can be quite sure, that the 3D scattering 
	implementation is correct!

2003-01-28  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

    	* arts-1-1-433

2003-01-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-431

	* Nearly completed binary file support.
	Missing features: - Integration into arts workspace.
	                  - Storing of Numeric/Index type in xml file.
			    -> Currently binary files must be read with the
			       same Numeric/Index type as they where written.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added test_binaryio target.
	Added b(i|o)fstream.{cc,h} where needed.

	* src/test_binaryio.cc: Added for testing binary io routines.

 	* src/xml_io.{h,cc}, src/xml_io_private.h: xml_write_to_file
	functions take now three parameters. Third arg is the type of file to
	write (FTYPE_ASCII or FTYPE_BINARY). Default is ASCII.
	Changed parameters for xml_{write_to,read_from}_stream functions:
	Removed parameters is_data and os_data. Instead, a pointer to
	bifstream / bofstream is passed to the function. If the pointer is
	NULL the data is written to/read from the xml file, otherwise the
	binary stream is used.

	* src/bifstream.h: Removed ios::trunc from default openmode.

	* src/b(i|o)stream.{h,cc}: Added operator template instanciations for
	types int and long.

	* src/.cvsignore: Added test_binaryio.

2003-01-27  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-430

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Made notation of the extinction matrix

	* src/zeemanproperties.h: The same for this file.

	* src/test_zeemanproperties.cc: The same for this file.

	* arts-1-1-429

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetClearsky): Bug fixed in 3D part. The 
	limits of some loops were wrong.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (scat_fieldCalc): Fixed 3D part:
	Included (pha_mat_sptCalc), this function was missing, so that the 
	value of the scattering integral was always 0.
	Included also some dubugging outputs which will be removed
	later.

	* src/special_interp.cc: Reincluded iostream.

2003-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* Removed inclusion of iostream from some files.

2003-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-427

	* src/ppath.cc: Further work on 3D and float. Unfortunately (or
	maybe it could have been foreseen) it turned out that the spatial
	precision for 3D and float is as bad as 10 m. The smallest
	rounding error when going going to cartesian coordinates and back to
	spherical, shifts the position with about 1 m and some accumaled errors
	rise the error up to 10m. This high uncertainty makes the present
	solution in do_gridcell_3d impossible, it is very likely to end up
	in a situation that cannot be resolved. For double the spatial precison
	is about 1e-6 m, and the risk to end up in problems is very very small.
	I have to think about what to do. For the moment, use double.

	* arts-1-1-426

	* Sorry for the exceeding commit rate, but I have to test the changes
	on different computers...

	* src/continua.cc: More pow fixes. Overloading of pow for both
	pow(float,double) and pow(double,float) breaks float compilation with
	gcc2. Added f to the numeric literals.

	* src/math_funcs.{cc,h}: Removed pow (float,double). Confuses gcc2 in
	many cases and we don't need it currently.

2003-01-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-425

	* src/continua.cc: Fixed pow(Numeric n, int i) calls. For simple cases
	with i = 2 replaced by n*n. For other cases using 2. instead of 2

2003-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-424

	* src/math_funcs.{cc,h}: Added functions pow(float, double) and

	* src/continua.cc: Include math_funcs.h for additional pow functions.

	* src/ppath.cc: Changed constant from int to double as second argument
	to pow in some places.

2003-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* src/xml_io_private.h: Added prototypes for xml_open_output_file
	and xml_open_input_file.

2003-01-23  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-422

	* src/ppath.cc: Compiles now without any warnings with Numeric=float.

2003-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-421

	* src/complex.{cc,h}: Added operator+ and operator* for arithmetic
	expressions where one argument is float and the other complex<double>
	(or double and complex<float>).
	The STL only contains functions for operands of same type such as
	float * complex<float>.

2003-01-23  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-420
	
	* src/ppath.cc: Continued the work to hard-code double in the most 
	critical functions. Don't compile without warnings with Numeric=float,
	but other parts don't compile at all with that option.
	
2003-01-23  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-419
	
	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Included index command to make an index for 
	workspace agendas (\wsaindex). It works as \wsmindex.
	
	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Rewritten documentation for 
	(i_fieldUpdateXX).

	* src/math_funcs.cc (AngIntegrate_trapezoid): Modified doxygen
	header.

2003-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-418

	* src/bifstream.h src/bifstream.cc: Added class for binary input.

	* src/bofstream.cc: Removed matpackI include.

	* src/bofstream.h: Removed destructor.

	* src/Makefile.am (arts_SOURCES): Added bifstream.{h,cc}.

2003-01-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-417

	* src/.cvsignore: Added test_zeemanproperties.

2003-01-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-416

	* src/methods.h: Include iosfwd instead of iostream.
	(MdRecord::operator=): Replaced cout by out0.

	* src/xml_io.h: Include iosfwd instead of iostream.

	* src/gridded_fields.cc: Removed duplicate iostream include.

	* src/lin_alg.cc src/math_funcs.cc src/m_cloudbox.cc
	src/m_refraction.cc src/scatproperties.cc: Removed unnecessary
	iostream include.

	Note about iostream: Wherever possible, including iostream should be
	avoided because it has quite alot of overhead. If you use cout
	temporarely for debugging, don't forget to remove the iostream include
	together with the debug code afterwards.

	For header files containing function/class declarations which need
	only references to iostream classes, it is highly recommended to
	include iosfwd instead of iostream. iosfwd contains only forwarded
	class declarations which significantly affects compilation speed.

2003-01-22  Nikolay Koulev  <nkoulev@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-415

	* src/zeemanproperties.cc: Added this file, containing the basic
	routines for calculating the extinction matrix and the
	absorption vector by the Zeeman effect..

	* src/zeemanproperties.h: Header file for the zeemanproperties.cc.

	* src/test_zeemanproperties.cc: Test file for the Zeeman routines.

	* src/zeeman_intensity_coeff.xml: XML table of the intensity
	coefficients for the different transitions of the O2 Zeeman
	effect, used in zeemanproperties.cc.
	
2003-01-22  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-414

	* src/ppath.cc: Started the work to make things work for Numeric=float,
	but got time for just a few changes.

2003-01-22  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-413	

	* doc/uguide/integration.tex: Included mathematical description of the
	used integration method.
	
2003-01-21  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-412

	* src/ppath.cc: Wrote some comments and made all function argument
	lists (in the headers) complete.
	
	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): Added check that zenith 
	angle does not go outside +-180.

2003-01-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-411

	* src/bofstream.{h,cc}: Added. Contains class for writing binary data
	by using output operators <<.

	* src/Makefile.am (arts_SOURCES): Added bofstream.{h,cc}.

2003-01-21  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-410

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetClearsky): Pressure interpolation 
	changed from linear to logarithmic.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc): Also changed the pressure
	interpolation to logarithmic.

	* src/workspace.cc: Changed documentation of *tensor6_1*, it is a dummy
	variable to be used when you need a tensor6 somewhere.

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Started updating this chapter. 

2003-01-21  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-409

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_euler): Put in some fixes to 
	improve the accuracy for zenith and azimuth angles. Included also
	checks that those angles do not go outside allowed ranges.

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_index_thayer_1974): Finally changed old
	parameter values (from Boudouris) to the ones from Thayer.

2003-01-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-408

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_gradients_1d): Created this function.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (RefrIndexFieldAndGradients): Finished this
	function.
	
	* src/refraction.cc: 
	* src/ppath.cc: Changes to get a nice verbosity for refr_index_agenda. 

2003-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-407

	* src/xml_io.cc: Updated doxygen comments.

2003-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-406

	* src/xml_io.cc, src/xml_io_private.h: Changed signatures of
	xml_read_from_stream/xml_write_to_stream functions. First step for
	binary file support. The read/write functions are now getting two
	streams as parameters. One is the file stream for the xml file and
	one the file stream where the data is written to. For ascii files both
	are the same, for binary the xml_data stream is a reference to the
	binary stream. This will make it possible to use the same
	reading/writing routines for both ascii and binary files.

2003-01-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-405

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_gradients_2d/3d): Changed the definition
	of the lat and lon gradients. The returned values are now the change
	of the refractive index over 1m, not 1 radian.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d/3d_linear_euler): Adapted to change above.

	* src/special_interp.cc (p2gridpos): Created this function. This
	function SHALL be used when interpolating in pressure. See email
	to arts-dev.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (RefrIndexFieldAndGradients): Function basically
	finished, but there is not yet any function for 1D giving the radial
	gradient (which is not needed to calculate the paths, but can be 
	interesting to plot).

2003-01-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-404

	* src/refraction.cc: Changes in most functions to change vertical
	input coordinate from geometric altitude to radius, which is needed
	to get lat and lon gradients correct. 

	* src/m_refraction.cc (RefrIndexFieldAndGradients): Started on this
	WSM.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Introduced tensor3_1 and
	tensor4_1.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_2d): Introduced a more correct setting
	of the latitude of the end point, for positions between lat1 and lat3.

	* src/refraction.cc: Included input arguments to control the
	verbosity when calling *refr_index_agenda*, but there is now no
	way to use this argument as *refr_index_agenda* is called as part
	of *ppath_step_agenda* and no such argument can be passed from one
	agenda to next.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Improved the accuracy for
	sensor positions outside the atmosphere and zenith angles of 180
	and/or azimuth angles of 0 or 180 degrees.

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_gradients_3d): The variable dndlon was not 
	set (dndlat was set twice).

2003-01-19  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-403

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_euler): Put in code for 3D with
	refraction. The stuff runs, but I have to check the used expressions
	and results more carefully.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexUnit): Created this WSM.

	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_3d): Found a bug. Latitude grid
	position was set twice, and longitude grid position not at all.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_2d): Fixed two bugs connected to the 
	tangent point for limb sounding with negative zenith angles.

2003-01-18  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-402

	* src/rte.cc (rte_calc): Forgot to mention that I introdoced this 
	function. It does what RteCalc did, but has the option that input 
	checks can be skipped. This saves some time in CloudboxGetIncoming.

2003-01-18  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-401

	* src/ppath.cc (gridcell_crossing_3d): Found a bug that affected the
	calculated length to a crossing of a given latitude. The original
	code was correct, but I later removed the calculation of 
	(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2) as this term is always 1. I was then too quick and 
	made a mistake. This bug fix solves the problem discussed for 
	version 1-1-393. Great!

2003-01-18  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-400
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Some temporary messages
	that will be removed later (to check speed issues).

	* src/ppath.cc (gridcell_crossing_3d): Fixed a bug when both solutions
	for the length >= 0, and of them is 0. The length criterion for
	solutions close to zero is now applied consistently.

	(do_gridcell_3d): Allowed some marginals for the lat and lon asserts
	in the middle of the function. The values are later corrected as far
	as possible.

	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_3d): Created this function.

	(refr_gradients_3d): Created this function.

2003-01-17  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>
	
	* arts-1-1-399

	* src/rte.cc (rte_step): Change condition for unpolarized case 
	(extinction matrix diagonal). The
	problem is, that if you do a calculation for 2 Stokes dimensions,
	the extinction matrix can be diagonal although the radiation is 
	polarised. Now the unpolarised calculation is performed if the
	extinction matrix is diagonal AND all components except the first
	of the absorption vector are zero.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Changed the size of the
	interface variables scat_i_XXX. So far they were defined on the
	full atmospheric grids which is not necessary. Now they are only
	defined inside the cloudbox boundaries. Loop indices had to be adapted 
	according to this change.

	* src/scat_rte.cc (ScatteringMain): Commented CloudboxGetIncoming. 
	For testing constant values for the boundary variables are used.
	(i_fieldUpdate3D): Fixed bugs in the radiative transfer part. 
	The function runs without crashes but I have to do some tests before
	I can assure that it works.
	
2003-01-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-398

	* src/xml_io.cc: Detailed output goes now to out3. Only filenames of
	input/output files are reported to out2.

2003-01-16  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-397

	* Paths with refraction for 1D and 2D have been tested and everything
	appears to work. 
	
	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_2d): Wrong dimension was read to
	determine the number of species.

	* src/ppath.cc: Included more asserts in the key functions for 3D to
	catch problems as early as possible.
	
	(psurface_crossing_3d): Started on a new version of this function.
	For the moment it is only allowed to use pressure surfaces with
	constant radius. That is, the geoid must be spherical and the 
	atmosphere spherically symmetric.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Found some problematic 
	points, reported to Claudia.

2003-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-396

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_gradients_2d): Created this function.
	2D paths with refraction are now completed, but no tests have been
	performed.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Added more asserts that should give
	an earlier and clear indication on that something has gone wrong.

	(psurface_crossing_2d): Removed some checks that had no impact (for
	the approximative solution, dlat = 0 was acceped if r0!=rp, but that 
	can never happen as za=0 and za=180 are handled seperately).

	(raytrace_1d_linear_euler): Cleaned up the code and removed some
	variables that were not really needed.

	(raytrace_2d_linear_euler): As above and added call of
	refr_gradients_2d. 

2003-01-15  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-395
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetClearsky). Fixed some bugs here. Limits 
	of the loops were wrong. Tested now for 3D.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (scat_fieldCalc). Fixed similar bug here. Now the
	3D function works. 
	(i_fieldUpdate3D) Also wrong limits at some places. A problem in the
	interpolation on the intersection point still has to be fixed.

2003-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-394

	* src/ppath.cc: I don't think that I have made any real changes, but
	a commit just in case if there is something I have missed.

	Still problems with a non-spherical geoid. A test to calculate the
	ingoing field to the cloud box for 3D and a spherical geoid was
	succesful.

	Claudia, you better make an update to make sure we use exactly the
	same version.

2003-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-393

	* src/ppath.cc (gridcell_crossing_3d): I discovered that there is
	an inconsistency between the tangent point position obtained by
	doing repeated path steps, and a direct calculation with 
	geompath_tanpos_3d. The error, as a vertical displacement, is about
	1.5 km. I have spent some time on trying to understand this, and
	my guess is that the problems appear in this function, but I have no
	final confirmation, and I don't know right now what to do about it. 
	
	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_1/2/3d): The tangent point is now not
	flagged as as an end face. A new flag especially for the tangent
	point has been introduced. No real imrpovement, but more logically
	as the tangent point is not an end face.
	
	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Cases when a path step both starts 
	and ends at the top surface, without having a tangent point inside the
	cell is now handled.

2003-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-392

	* src/ppath.cc: Just a commit to transfer last changes to laptop.

2003-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-391

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Fixed a bug. The longitude
	index was not set following the cloud box limits.

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_crossing_3d): A slight improvement that should
	lower the chance for failures. However, another algorithm will be 
	tested.

2003-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-390

	* src/ppath.cc: Work on 3D paths to handle all possible problems
	due to numerical inaccuracy. More work to be done (despite I have
	spent most of the day on this!), at least for cases with highly
	distorted grid cells. Can maybe work for nicer cases.

	* src/rte.cc (get_radiative_background): RteCalc is now not called
	if the ground is set to be a blackbody. Everything worked, but this
	saves some time.

2003-01-14  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-389	
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Included 3D parts for (scat_iPut) and 
	(CloudboxGetOutgoing). Now, all 3D functions for the scattering
	part are ready to be tested!

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc: Included checks and error messages. 
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Only small modifications. Mainly documentation.

2003-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-388

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexThayer): Finished this function and
	moved some code to refr_index_thayer_1974.

	* src/refraction.h: Created this file. 

	* src/refraction.cc: Added this file and moved get_refr_index_1d to
	to this file. Made new version of get_refr_index_2d. Created the
	function refr_index_thayer_1974.

	* src/ppath.cc: Added input arguments to some function as a preperation
	for 2D with refrcation.

2003-01-13  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-387

	* src/ppath.cc: I had two parallel ways to number the corner points of
	3D grid cells. Fixed. Also more stringent naming between 2D and 3D.

	(psurface_crossing_3d): Fixed a bug that appeared when the radius
	of pressure surfaces is not constant. I had been sloppy in checking 
	such cases.
	
	(ppath_calc): Fixed a bug (hopefully) reported by Oliver (that went
	through my compiler).

2003-01-13  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-386

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Some smaller improvements for 
	special zenith and azimuth angles.

2003-01-13  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-385

	* src/absorption.cc (find_first_species_tg): Added. Finds first
	occurrence of species in tag groups. The species to look for
	must be specified by its species index, not by the name!
	(species_index_from_species_name): Added. Returns species index
	for given species name.

	You can use both functions together to find the first water vapor
	tag:
	Index firstH2O
	   = find_first_species_tg(species_index_from_species_name("H2O"))

	If there is no water vapor in the tag list the result will be -1.
	
	* src/absorption.h: Added declarations for the two new functions.

2003-01-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-384

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Removed uguide.ps.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/{*.eps,*/*.eps}: Removed all eps files.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/{Makefile.am,*/Makefile.am}: Removed *eps from file
	list.

2003-01-13  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-383

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetConst): Included the 3D part. The 
	function is used to set the radiation field to a constant value
	inside the cloudbox. The convergence test (same solution for 
	different initial fields) should also be done for the 3D 
	calculations.

	* doc/examples/cloud_rad_field1D_example.arts.in: Fixed some typos
	in documentation.

2003-01-12  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-382

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Added some code to try to catch a
	problem due to numerical problems with path start points on top of
	a pressure surface. Problem reported by Claudia.

2003-01-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-381

	* configure.in: Applied patch provided by Randall Skelton
	<rhskelto@atm.ox.ac.uk>:
	configure can now be told where it should look for the HDF library.
	Added LDFLAGS to the configuration summary.

2003-01-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-380

	* src/agendas.cc: Fixed bug in *refr_index_agenda* entry.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc: Checks for raw data commented because they 
	gave wrong error messages. They will be modified later.

2003-01-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-379

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, src/m_scatrte.cc: Replaced stdlib.h by cstdlib. We
	should always include the c++ versions of the header files.

	* src/m_refraction.cc: Replaced iostream.h by iostream.

	* src/old_absorption.cc: Replaced math.h by cmath.

2003-01-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-378

	Check-in failed for version arts-1-1-376.

2003-01-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-377

	* src/ppath.cc (varoius functions): Continued to change input and

	all the way down through all levels of functions.

2003-01-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexThayer): Renamed refr_indexBoudouris.

	Add now added this file to the CVS repository. Sorry for the miss.

2003-01-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-374

	* src/agendas.cc: Added the agenda refr_index_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added the WSV refr_index. 

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexBoudouris): Added this file and
	this function.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepRefractionEuler): Added new input 
	arguments.

2003-01-09  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-373

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc): Added checks for the 
	consistency of input variables.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Fixed a bug in the
	3D part of the function.
	The sensor azimuth angle grid goes from -180° to + 180° whereas 
	the scattering azimuth angle grid is defined from 0° to 360°. 
	This caused a problem when calling RteCalc for all directions.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Minor modification.

	* doc/examples/cloud_rad_field1D_example.arts.in: Added this example 
	control file for a 1D scattering calculation. The radiation field
	inside the cloudbox is calculated and all iterations are written
	into files.

	* doc/examples/Makefile.am: Included example above.

	* doc/uguide/matrix_vector.tex: Added documentation for using
	naked jokers in matrices and tensors.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Added test for using naked joker in Vector.

	* Clear sky spectra has now been produced with real absorption for 
	1D, 2D and 3D. AND IT WORKS!!!! Time to celebrate.

	Spectra were calculated for cases that should be identical for 1D,
	2D and 3D. If lmax in ppath_stepGeometric is set to -1, some 
	difference is noted between 1D and 2D/3D, as the crossings of the
	latitude grid in 2D/3D results in some extra points of the path which
	requieres an interpolation in pressure, not performed for 1D.
	If lmax is set to e.g. 1e3, the difference is very small (probably
	only rounding errors), which should be expected. 

	So the consistency between 1D, 2D and 3D seems to be OK. At least
	for geometric paths.
	
	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalcExpand1D): Created this function
	to make "2D or 3D view" of a 1D atmsophere.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): The order of some lines were wrong. 
	Fixed that bug for 2D and 3D, and cleaned the code slightly.

2003-01-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-369
	
	* src/xml_io.cc: Moved xml class declarations to xml_io_private.h.

	Reimplemented String and SpeciesTag reading routines to improve error
	and whitespace handling.

	* src/xml_io_private.h: Moved xml class declarations here.

	* arts-1-1-368	
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate3D): Added this function to calculte
	3D radiative transfer inside the cloudbox. To test this function
	and also the 3D ppath functions I have to create 3D test scenarions.

	(i_fieldIterate): Included 3D case.

	* src/methods.cc: Added (i_fieldUpdate3D).
	
2003-01-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-367

	* src/xml_io.cc: Improved parsing of String and SpeciesTag.

	IMPORTANT: Strings in ARTS XML file !!!MUST!!! be put inside quotes
	"". I think nobody wrote strings to xml files before but if so, you
	have to edit your xml files and add the quotes manually.

2003-01-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-366

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): This is now only a getaway function to
	ppath_calc, with agenda_verb = 0. For internal functions ppath_calc
	shall be called instead of this function.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): Introduced a variable to get a more nice
	verbosity of the different agendas called.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Copied everything from old ppathCalc to 
	this function and added a new input argument to control verbosity of
	ppath_step_agenda.

2003-01-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-365

	* src/xml_io.cc, src/xml_io_private.h: Added reading/writing routines
	for Ppath, GridPos and ArrayOfGridPos.

2003-01-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-364

	* src/special_interp.h: Fixed typo.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): Modified the code added by Claudia
	to be a bit more efficient and to make use of some special 
	interpolation functions. 

	PLEASE NOTE: As it is the log of the pressure that is assumed vary
	linearly with altitude, the ordinary interpolation functions can't
	be used directly. The function *itw2p* is a special function 
	for interpolating pressure, but this should be done in very few
	places.

	Untabified the file.

2003-01-07  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-363

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ext_matInit), (abs_vecInit): Modified
	these functions. The scattering calculations are monochromatic. So
	the frequency dimension of these two variables has to be 1. 
	*f_index* can be used for determine, whether the initialisaition is
	done in a clearsky calculation or in a cloudbox calculation. 
	If f_index > 0 it is done in a cloudbox calculation.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): Rewritten this function. Now 
	absorption is calculated for all ppath points using 
	*scalar_gas_abs_agenda*. 

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Executing the finished
	*scalar_gas_absorption_agenda* required some modifications and 
	additional variables.

	* src/methods.cc: Modified interfaces of (RteEmissionStd), 
	(i_fieldUpdate1D),  (ext_matInit) and (abs_vecInit).

	* src/rte.cc (rte_clearsky_with_emission): Removed. The general
	RT function (rte_step) can handle this special case and is 
	used everywhere, now.

	* src/test_linalg.cc: Removed unused variables.

2003-01-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-362

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): A start point, with a radius equal
	to the ground radius, could result in an intersection with the ground
	even if the zenith angle is upwards. Fixed (hopefully).

	* src/m_ppath.cc (sensor_posAddGeoidWGS84): Changed the code for 2D
	and 3D as the old version did not work when the latitudes are not
	sorted. 

	* src/m_basic_types.cc 
	(VectorSetElement): Created this WSM.
	(MatrixSetElement): Created this WSM.
	(MatrixSetTakingSizeFromMatrix): Created this WSM.
	
2003-01-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-361

	* src/matpackI.{h,cc}: Commented out assignment operators for Vector
	with parameter type Array<Numeric>. If we want to split matpack from
	arts it should not depend on Array which belongs to arts, not to
	matpack.

	* src/parser.cc (parse_numvector): Use loop to copy Array<Numeric> to
	Vector because assignment operator is not longer present.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Commented out test16 (Test for Array<Numeric>
	-> Vector assignment).

2003-01-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-360

	* doc/index.html.in: Fixed link to pdf version of Uguide.

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Updated documentation about using
	assertions with gdb.

	* src/arts.h: Updated GNU license information.

2003-01-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-359
	
	* It should now be possible to produce clear sky 3D spectra. However,
	no practical tests performed.
	
	* src/rte.cc (ground_specular_los): 3D activated, but ground tilt
	is not yet included. I wrote some codeto consider the ground tilt
	but I will look for a better and general solution, and the code is not
	active.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): Included check that the atmosphere is 3D
	when a 2D antenna is selected.

2003-01-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-358

	* src/array.h: Define all Arrays and ArraysOfArray here.
	NOTE: Only the typedefs are located here. If you want to use e.g.
	ArrayOfTensor3, it is not enough to include array.h, you also have to
	include matpackIII.h.

	* src/matpack*.h: Removed typedefs for Arrays.

	* src/arts.h: Removed typedefs for ArrayOfIndex and ArrayOfNumeric.

2003-01-05  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-357

	* src/ppath.cc: Several things fixed to make path along the end 
	longitudes to work. Longitudes can now be in the range [-360,360], as
	described in AUG.

	I have tested a number of waht should be nasty cases and everything 
	worked. It seems that 3D geometrical paths are now working.

2003-01-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-356

	* Paths above the pole are now basically working, except along lon
	+-180 degrees. Numerical inaccuracy is especially tricky around the
	poles (with the equations I have derived at least) and I don't
	think I will manage to solve all problems. Right now I consider
	to take back my decision to restrict lon_grid to [-180,180], which
	would be better for the usage and paths exectly at the border of
	the atmosphere could be avoided. But I want to document the present
	solution.

	* src/ppath.cc: Fixes in several functions to make things work for
	paths passing the poles. The fixes are needed as the longitude is
	undefined at the poles and as the azimuth angle is defined in
	other way at the poles.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Some fixes for the same reasons as above.

2003-01-01  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-355

	* 3D geometrical paths are not finished, but it is not too far away.
	Path passing exactly above the poles are not OK, but no other known
	bugs. Path passing longitude +-180 are working.

	Definition of accepted longitudes is changed. Longitudes must now
	be inside [-180,180]. To cover the whole globe, lowest and highest
	longitude must be -180 and 180, respectively. (AUG not updated on
	this point).

	I have done quite some cleaning, both for 2D and 3D. So 2D must be
	checked carefully later. My plan now is to finish all dimensions,
	with and without refraction, and make a careful, parallell check
	of all cases later.
	
	* src/ppath.cc: Fixed uncountable bugs, such as dividing with a
	trigonometric function becoming 0, lat index for longituide grids and
	pure logical mistakes. And ...

	* src/interpolation.h: Added declaration of functions for "red
	interpolation". The functions existed in interpolation.cc, but where
	not visible to the outside world. 

	(Stefan, any reason for this that I have missed? I hope not, because
	I use now the red interpolation in many places.)

	* src/interpolation.cc (gridpos): Created a second version where a
	GridPos is created, instead of ArrayOfGridPos.

2002-12-30  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-354

	* src/ppath.cc: Code for 3D geometrical path steps compiles but 
	so far no tests, beside for do_gridcell_3d and sub-functions.
	A number of new functions:
	   poslos2cart
           cart2poslos
           gridcell_crossing_3d
	   rsurf_at_latlon
	   psurface_slope_3d
	   psurface_crossing_3d
	   ppath_start_3d
	   ppath_end_3d
	
2002-12-25  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-353

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Started on this function. So far 
	empty.
	
	(sph2cart): Created.

	* src/methods.cc: Created WSM DoGridCell3D. 

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_slope_2d): Created a second version of this 
	function, not taking vectors as input.

	* src/rte.cc (ground_specular_los): Changed call of do_gridcell_2d.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (DoGridcell2D): Changed call of do_gridcell_2d.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_2d) - (do_gridcell_2d): Removed c2 and
	c4 as output of ppath_start_2d, and the transfer of these variables
	down to do_gridcell_2d, where the variables now are calculated 
	internally.

2002-12-21  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-352

	* src/m_ppath.cc (DoGridcell2D): Added this WSM. This WSM should 
	normally not be used. It is intended for test of the function 
	do_gridcell_2d, and to make figures for AUG. This function can be
	called from Atmlab. 

2002-12-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-351

	* ami: Removed.

	* configure.in: Removed ami Makefiles.

	* Makefile.am: Removed ami directory.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc: Include cmath instead of math.h.

2002-12-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-350

	* src/m_optproperties.cc: Added #include <math.h> because acos was 
	not found.

	* src/ppath.cc (geompath_from_r1_to_r2): Improved a comment

2002-12-20  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-349

	Two big changes in this version:

	1. A first version of the gas absorption lookup table is ready and
	tested. I implemented a field variable for gas absorption, and a
	method to calculate absorption for all points in the field, in
	order to be able to do some testing. It is as yet unclear whether
	this could be useful also in other places.

	2. Changed copy semantics for Array, Vector, and Tensors. Now the
	output argument is resized automatically. This was necessary to
	ensure that structures containing these objects are copied
	correctly. User code in ARTS is not affected, you should continue
	to use these data types exactly as you have done so far. In
	particular, views still have to match exactly, of course.

	Detailed changes:
	
	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc: Some bug fixes and some cosmetic changes.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added abs_scalar_gas_field.
	It contains the scalar gas absorption for all species as a function of
	f_grid, p_grid, lat_grid, and lon_grid. 
	This is mainly for testing and plotting gas absorption. For RT
	calculations, gas absorption is calculated or extracted locally,
	therefore there is no need to store a global field. But this variable
	is handy for easy plotting of absorption vs. pressure, for example.

	* src/m_absorption.cc (abs_scalar_gas_fieldCalc): Added. 
	Calculates scalar gas absorption for all points in the atmosphere.
	An agenda is used to obtain absorption for one point at a time.
	
	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): Added abs_scalar_gas_fieldCalc.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Added input parameters and
	documentation to scalar_gas_absorption_agenda.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_field): Added a version of this
	function for vmr_field (which is a Tensor4, not a Tensor3 like the
	other fields).

	* src/check_input.h: Updated.

	* src/array.h: Changed copy semantics. Operator= now adjusts dimension
	of target automatically.

	* src/matpackI.cc: Changed copy semantics for Vector and Matrix
	(not for VectorView and MatrixView!). Operator= now adjusts dimension
	of target automatically.

	* src/matpackIII.cc: Dito for Tensor3.

	* src/matpackIV.cc: Dito for Tensor4.

	* src/matpackV.cc: Dito for Tensor5.

	* src/matpackVI.cc: Dito for Tensor6.

	* src/matpackVII.cc: Dito for Tensor7.

	* src/matpackI.h: Only changes in comments.

	* src/test_matpack.cc (test35): A test for the new copy
	semantics. Only tested for Vector! Hope it works also for the
	higher order tensors...

	* doc/uguide/matrix_vector.tex: Updated text about copy
	semantics.

	the definitions are omitted.

2002-12-19  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-346

	* src/agendas.cc (opt_prop_gas_agenda): Removed *f_index* from input
	variables list.
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Added the 3D version. 
			
	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Inserted an assertion for number of 
	points in ppath.

	* src/ppath.cc: Bug fixed according to Patrick's suggestion. 
	Assure that 'n = Index( ceil( fabs( l2 - l1 ) / lmax ) )' does not
	become 0.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Minor modifications and included output messages.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Removed *abs_vec* from input list to function 
	*abs_vecInit*.

2002-12-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-345

	* src/complex.{h,cc}: Removed Complex class implementation and
	replaced it with a typedef complex<Numeric> Complex. If there is any
	need to implement functionality for complex numbers not covered by the
	STL class, add them here.

	* src/test_complex.cc: Adapted for new complex class.

2002-12-19  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>
	
	* arts-1-1-344
	
	* src/m_optproperties.cc: The method *amp_matCalc* is modified to
	include the case of macroscopically symmetric and isotropic
	particles.  Removed the argument *stokes_dim* from
	the methods calculating scattering properties. Modified
	accordingly when they are called in m_scatrte.cc.  Also did some
	cosmetic changes so that they look better in doxygen.  

	* src/methods.cc: Removed the input stokes_dim from the methods
	calculating scattering properties. 
	
	* src/scattproperties.cc: Cosmetic changes so that they look
	better in doxygen. 
	
2002-12-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	opening tag was not followed by whitespace.

2002-12-19  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* src/absorption.cc (SpeciesTag): Added white space removal to
	constructor from string for SpeciesTag.

	* src/m_absorption.cc (gas_speciesSet): Moved white space removal
	to SpeciesTag constuctor.

	* src/xml_io.cc: Work in progress (together with Oliver).

2002-12-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	Reintroduced BUILT_SOURCES to fix bug discovered by Christian,
	removed special targets and explicit dependencies for make_auto*.

	* src/test_complex.cc: Added some new test examples on complex numbers.
	
2002-12-16  Mattias Ekström  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-336

	* configure.in: Just a demonstration commit to show Mattias how CVS
	works.

2002-12-16 Stefan Buehler <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-335

	* src/complex.h: Complex numbers for ARTS. This is a quick
	implementation of complex numbers. I think most of the basic
	features are there. The operators += and + are already implemented
	as examples for the other operators.

	Have I forgotten anything important? Documentation for AUG must
	still be written!
	
	* src/complex.cc: Source file for complex numbers. At the moment
	only the output operator is here, all member function
	implementations are in the class declaration in complex.h.

	* src/test_complex.cc: Test complex numbers.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added new target test_complex.

2002-12-12  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-334

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (Extract): Cosmetic changes to Doxygen header.

2002-12-12  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-333

	* I think all methods for using gas lookup tables are there now,
	although not all cases are implemented inside the methods. NOTHING
	IS TESTED YET, THOUGH.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Updated documentation of:
	abs_scalar_gas,
	Added WSV gas_abs_lookup_is_adapted, a flag indicating that the
	lookup table has been adapted to the current calculation.
	
	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): Added the new methods:
	abs_scalar_gasExtractFromLookup,
	gas_abs_lookupAdapt.

	Updated the methods:
	ext_matInit,
	ext_matAddGas,
	abs_vecInit,
	abs_vecAddGas. 
	Removed unnecessary arguments and cleaned up the documentation. 

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: The variable abs_scalar_gas is a Matrix, not a
	Vector. The dimensions are [f_grid,gas_species]. We are not taking
	the sum of the gas absorption for the different species here, the
	sum is taken inside ext_matAddGas and abs_vecAddGas.

	The helper variable scalar_gas_array, which is used in some
	places, is now also a matrix, because it has to store the
	absorption for the different gas species separately.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc: Removed unnecessary #includes.
	(ext_matInit): Added.
	(ext_matAddGas): Rewritten.
	(abs_vecInit): Added.
	(abs_vecAddGas): Rewritten.

	Note that in all these methods there is no need for a distinction
	between the cases inside and outside the scattering box. Only the
	leading dimensions of the arguments are different. The methods are
	now quite simple.

	* src/m_absorption.cc (gas_abs_lookupAdapt): Added.
	(abs_scalar_gasExtractFromLookup): Added.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Updated.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc: Mostly cosmetic changes here.

2002-12-11  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-332

	* src/interpolation.cc: Allow a little bit of extrapolation. To be
	precise, we require that the new grid is no more than half a grid
	spacing away on either side of the old grid. Extrapolation to such
	a short distance should be safe. The main reason for this
	modification is that it solves the numerical problems that used to
	occur if the new grid was practically the same as the old
	grid. (In these cases the edge values of the new grid numerically
	sometimes happened to fall just outside the old grid.)

	This has the important consequence, that fractional distances can
	be <0 and >1 for points outside the original grid range. The new
	condition is that -.5 <= fd <= 1.5. The sum of all weights still
	is one, of course.

	(All functions:) Modified the assertion that compared the sum of
	all weights to 1 to use the new "fuzzy" comparison function (see
	below). This was necessary because numerical noise led to spurious
	failures of the original sharp assertion statement.
	
	* src/logic.cc (is_same_within_epsilon): Added. This function
	implements comparison of two numbers as recommended by
	Oliver. Both the two numbers and the comparison epsilon have to be
	specified.

	I recommend to always use this function for this task in future,
	so that we have some consistency. It is applicable in cases where
	there is no physical justification to require a certain absolute
	agreement. Instead, it checks that the two numbers agree to a
	certain number of digits.

	* src/logic.h: Updated.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc (test06): Added this test for the new
	extrapolation feature.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added make_vector to sources for

	* arts-1-1-331

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc): Small modifications. This 
	method is now tested and is working.

	* src/m_io.cc (AtmFieldsFromAscii2Xml): Included this method. It 
	converts atmospheric data from ascii to xml and writes the 
	atmospheric fields (temperature, altitude, vmr) as gridded fields,
	which can be read using (AtmRawRead).

	* src/methods.cc: Included (AtmFieldsFromAscii2Xml).

2002-12-06  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-330

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): Fixed typo bug in
	documentation of ppath_stepGeometric (removed backslash).
	(define_md_data_raw): Added method gas_speciesSet. This is
	basically the same method that used to be called tgsDefine in
	ARTS-1-0, except for the new feature of specifying "nl" instead of
	the isotope.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Fixed documentation of
	gas_species. 

	* src/old_absorption.cc: Moved define_species_map to absorption.cc.

	* src/absorption.cc (define_species_map): Moved over this function
	from old_absorption.cc

	* src/absorption.h: Updated.

	* src/m_abs.cc: Removed tgsDefine.

	* src/m_absorption.cc (gas_speciesSet): Added (from old tgsDefine).

	* src/main.cc: Initialize species_data and species_map.

	* doc/examples/absorption_lookup_example.arts.in: Added
	gas_speciesSet. 

	* src/mystring.h: Added a find function. But then I thought better
	of it and decided that for string we should continue to use
	string.find(). So, the new function is commented out.

2002-12-06  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-329

	*.cc, *.c, *.h: Untabified everything.

2002-12-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-328

	* src/ppath.cc: There are now fewer WSM, only ppath_stepGeometric
	and ppath_stepRefractionEuler. The different options are now selected
	by keywords. I found this easier than having a lot of WSMs. Especially
	as I decided to add another option for the refraction method. There is
	now an option for how the refractive index shall be determined, always
	calculated from scratch or interpolated from grid cell boundaries.
	See the on-line help for info.

	The special 1D option is not active for the moment. I have done this
	now in several ways and the results is always the same. If the tangent
	point is forced to be (very) exact, then the results do not converge
	when decreasing the ray tracing length. On the other hand, if the
	ray tracing is free to find its own tangent altitude, the results 
	converge (and a very close to perfect tangent altitude is found). It 
	must be the case that rounding errors balance each other in the second
	case. 

2002-12-02  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-327

	* Fixed bug reported by Patrick. It took a while to find this. The
	problem was that agendas were not copied correctly. Tracked the
	problem down to the copying of MRecords, which are a part of
	Agenda. The problem is that STRUCTURES CONTAINING ARRAYS ALWAYS
	MUST DEFINE THE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR. Otherwise copying the
	structure will trigger an assertion unless all arrays have the
	same size in original and target structure. That is of course not
	what we want, normally.

	* src/agenda_class.cc: (MRecord::operator=): Added. This is the
	bug fix.
	Also added output operator for MRecord and Agenda for
	debugging purposes. The implementation resides in .print() member
	functions for both classes.
	(Agenda::print): Added.
	(MRecord::print): Added.  Output operators and print functions are
	not tested!

	* src/agenda_class.h: Updated.

	* src/token.cc (operator<<): Fixed output format to look like the
	tokens are given in the controlfile. (Not tested, needed only for
	debugging.)

	* src/continua.cc (MPM93_N2_continuum): Commented out one line to
	remove unused variable warning.
	(PWR98H2OAbsModel): Commented out one line to remove unused
	variable warning.

2002-12-02  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-326

	* src/ppath.cc: Things have been moved around a bit. A pure Euler
	approach has been implemented for 1D (used in Euler/EulerWithLmax).
	The 1D and 2D versions give basically identical results. The results
	converge when making the step lengtn smaller.

	The special 1D version that gives a symmetric path around tangent 
	points is moved to be part of a new WSM ppath_stepRefraction1D. 
	The results for this version do not converge when making the ray 
	tracing step length shorter (and I can't find out why this is the 
	case).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (r_geoidSpherical): New WSM.

2002-12-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-325

	* src/array.h (find_all): pos has to be a reference.

	* src/absorption.cc (SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag): Use Stefan's
	find_first instead of the STL version.

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_header_from_stream): Slighty improved
	error message for invalid xml header.

2002-12-01  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-324

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_2d): Appears to be ready. In contrast
	to the 1D function, the results converge when making the ray tracing
	step length smaller. However, the algorithms differ slightly and I
	will copy the 2D algorithm to 1D to get 1D versions.

	Fixed several bugs in the functions of the file.

2002-11-29  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-323

	* src/agenda_class.cc Untabified.
	(execute): Implemented reporting level 4
	to override silent agenda execution.

	* src/main.cc Untabified.
	(set_reporting_level): Implemented reporting level 4
	to override silent agenda execution.

	* src/check_input.h: Untabified.
	(chk_size): Added.
	(chk_contains): Added. Checks if an array contains a certain
	value. Has to be here in the .h file, because it is a template
	function that works for any kind of array.

	* src/check_input.cc: Untabified.
	(chk_size): Added these functions for Vector up to Tensor7. They
	are similar to the is_size functions, but throw runtime errors
	with appropriate messages if the size does not match. Could be
	convenient for others as well, please use.

	* src/workspace.cc: Untabified.
	(define_wsv_data): Moved variable
	abs_scalar_gas to the right place and added documentation. 

	* src/methods.cc: Untabified.
	(define_md_data_raw): Put in stub for gas_abs_lookupAdapt method
	(still commented out).

	* src/parser.cc: Untabified. Removed unused variables. (Detected
	thanks to the great new warnings of Oliver.)

	* src/old_absorption.cc: Moved some stuff to absorption.cc.

	* src/absorption.cc: Untabified. Added some Functions for
	SpeciesTag. (Moved over from old_absorption.cc and updated.)

	* src/absorption.h: Ditto.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Updated.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (find_new_grid_in_old_grid): Added.
	(Adapt): Worked mainly on this function. It is now more or less
	complete, but not tested.

	* src/array.h: Untabified.
	(find_first): Added.
	(find_all): Added.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc: 
	(AtmRawRead): Added this method to read atmospheric scenarios.
	(AtmFieldsCalc): Added. Interpolates atmospheric fields on the
	atmospheric grids for the RT calculation.

	* src/methods.cc: Added methods above.

	* src/workspace.cc: Included WSVs for methods above:
		t_field_raw,
		z_field_raw,
		vmr_field_raw,
		vmr_field
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Removed some unused variables.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_2d): Finished this function.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): Created this function.
	Basically works but there are bugs to be removed.

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_crossing_2d): Fixed a bug for cases with
	presssure surfaces without any slope.

2002-11-28  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-320

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_2d): Moved parts of this function to
	seperate functions, to be used by the corresponding functions for
	refraction.

2002-11-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-319

	* ami/xml/xmlReadTensor*.m: Bug fix in indexing. The indexing is now
	the same as in arts.
	Example:  t = xmlLoad('tensor5.xml');   % Read tensor5
	          t(1,1,1,1,:)         % Print first row of tensor
	          t(:,1,1,1,1)         % Print first element of each shelf

	Array are treat as cells:
                  a = xmlLoad('arrmatrix.xml');   % Read array of matrix
	          a{1}(1,1)         % Print first element of first matrix
	          a{2}{1,:)         % Print first row of second matrix
	          a{2}              % Print second matrix
	
	* ami/xml/xmlReadTag.m: Added. Splitted tag parsing routine
	from xmlLoad.

	* ami/xml/xmlLoad.m: Moved parsing of tags to xmlReadTag.m.

	* ami/xml/xmlReadArray.m: Simplified by using xmlReadTag.

	* ami/xml/xmlReadGasAbsLookup.m: Added.

2002-11-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-318

	* configure.in: Added -Wconversion flag to warnings.

	Don't use -Wno-unused but -Wno-unused-parameter instead. Because
	we don't want to be harassed with unused function parameters but
	with unused variable we do. (gcc3 only)

	Changed the behaviour for the warning flags: By default -W -Wall
	-Wconversion are active. All warnings produced with this settings
	SHOULD BE FIXED!!!
	
	In certain cases it could be useful to turn on even more warnings by
	using --enable-more-warnings. But be warned, with this setting gcc
	becomes really rebellious. :-)

	Pass --enable-more-warnings to autogen.sh or configure. 
	You may get a lot of false alarms depending on your compiler version.

	-enable-more-warnings activates -Wshadow -Wunreachable-code (and more
	to come)

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): np was defined twice as local
	variable. Second declaration shadows first one. Number of pressure
	levels does not change -> removed second variable.

	* src/parser.cc (read_integer) and (read_numeric): Ony dummy
	variable shadows another.  Renamed second dummy variable to
	chtmp to make the code easier to understand.
	(parse_method): Same with iterator i.

	* src/mystring.h (my_basic_string): Renamed parameter npos to numpos
	to avoid shadowing of member attribute of same name.

	* src/make_wsv_pointers_cc.cc (main): Renamed parameter wsv_pointers
	in function define_wsv_pointers to ref_wsv_pointers to avoid
	shadowing of global wsv_pointers variable.

	* src/m_physics.cc (MatrixToTbByRJ): Removed unnecessary re-definition
	of irep, ii and icol from else block.

	* src/matpackI.h,cc (Range::Range): Renamed joker param in
	constructors to j to avoid shadowing of global joker object.

	* src/agenda_class.{h,cc} (Agenda::set_name): Renamed parameter name
	to nname to avoid shadowing of member function Agenda::name().

2002-11-28  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-317
	
	* src/logic.{cc,h} (is_singular), (is_diagonal): Implemented these 
	functions to check whether a matrix is singular or diagonal. 

	* src/agendas.cc (scat_mono_agenda): Modified input and 
	documentation. The method *amp_matCalc* has to be part of the 
	agenda as *amp_mat* stores the amplitude matrix for one
	frequency. Before we calculated amp_mat outside the agenda but this 
	can not work for more frequencies.

	* src/rte.cc (rte_step): Used is_diagonal.

	* src/scatrte.cc (ScatteringMain): Included a switch: If the frequency
	grid holds only 2 frequencys the radiation field inside the 
	cloudbox is only calculated for the first frequency.
	(i_fieldUpdate1D):
	Used is_singular.
	Executing all agendas silently now.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Ppath_step angenda is here executed
	silently now (exept when it is called for the first time).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Removed some "couts" which were only used
	for debugging.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ext_matAddGas), (abs_vecAddGas): Minor
	modifications.
	
2002-11-28  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-316
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D_PlaneParallel): This method is
	added.  The method is similar to i_fieldUpdate1D except that it
	takes that inside the cloudbox the atmosphere is
	planeparallel. 

	* src/methods.cc : Added the above method.  

2002-11-27  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-315

	* src/ppath.cc: No functionality changed, despite some small steps
	forward for 2D refraction, but the code has been restructured to
	make the code more compact and simplify the implementation of other
	ray tracing schemes.

	* arts-1-1-311

	* src/ppath.cc: A short report on quite a lot of work.
	I have been working on a basic function for 1D ppath steps with 
	refraction. I was not happy with the result for the first algorith so
	I tried several improvements. Now I understand that there are inherent
	problems and I finally selected an algorithm that can be extended to
	2D and 3D. This would help to check the implementation for the
	different dimensions. The WSM is now called ppath_stepRefractionEuler
	as the method used is basically an Euler solution of the differential
	problem.

	I will write this down sometime in AUG, but I take it shortly here.
	Unfortunately, the path calculations do not converge to some result
	when making the ray tracing steps smaller. It seems to converge when
	going down to step length of maybe 100 m, but then the results start
	to move away again. I can't find any bugs in my calculations (the
	result when setting the refractive index to 1 is perfect). It must be
	the case that when making the ray tracing step very small, rounding
	errors start to be noticed, making the final result to slide away.

	Several improvements are possible, but I will take that later. I will
	now implement the same approach for 2D, as a reference case for later,
	more elaborated, schemes.

	* arts-1-1-310
	
	* src/methods.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D) and (i_fieldIterate): Included 
	*abs_scalar_gas* in interface.
	
	* src/rte.cc (rte_step): Bug fixed. Assertion in check, if matrix is 
	diagonal had to be outside the loop.
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Modified.
	
	* src/agendas.cc (scalar_gas_absorption_agenda): Removed f_index 
	from input list for testing purposes.
		
	* src/m_optproperties.cc (abs_vecAddGas): Bug fixed.

	Now scattering calculations can be performed again for an example 
	absorption, which can be defined in the control file by setting
	the variable *abs_scalar_gas* in scalar_gas_absorption_agenda.
	
2002-11-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-309
	
	* src/getopt.c: Moved comment after include to separate line.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added constants.cc to test_interpolation_SOURCES.

	* configure.in: Use a more sophisticated way to determine whether we
	are using a GNU compiler.

2002-11-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-308

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h (class GasAbsLookup): Don't use
	qualified names in member function definition.

	* src/matpack*.{cc,h}: Reverted to version 1-1-303. "using" statement
	in class definition is not supported in gcc < 3.x. :-(
	Moved back iterator stuff into header after reverting.
	Moved all operators returning Numeric elements also to header files
	for performance reasons.

	* configure.in: Add "-ansi -pedantic" to compiler flags when gcc is
	in charge.

2002-11-25  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-307
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Included arguments to agendas
	to suppress output.

	* src/agendas.cc (opt_prop_gas_agenda) and  (opt_prop_part_agenda):
	Corrected input and output of these agendas again.

	* src/linalg.cc (ludcmp):  Bug fix to avoid possible use of
	uninitialized index.
	
2002-11-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-306

	* src/matpackI.h (class VectorView): Don't use qualified names in
	member function definition.

	* configure.in: Moved -DNDEBUG from compiler flags to preprocessor
	flags.

2002-11-25  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-305

	* src/agenda_class.h: Changed declaration of Agenda.

	* src/agenda_class.cc: Implemented an optional argument for
	Agenda::execute. If the argument is true, the agenda is executed
	silently, i.e., all output, except level 0 (error messages) is
	suppressed. 

	If you call Agenda::execute() in a loop, you should call it
	without argument for the first time, then call it with argument
	true for the remaining iterations.

	* src/arts.h: Removed the line about NDEBUG. This is set by
	configure --enable-debug or --disable-debug. Hence, it must not be
	set explicitly in the code.
	Moved include for cassert to another position.

	* src/m_hdf.cc: Removed inclusion of config.h. (This is included by
	arts.h.)

	* src/methods.cc: Removed inclusion of config.h. (This is included by
	arts.h.)

	* src/main.cc: Removed inclusion of config.h. (This is included by
	arts.h.)

2002-11-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-304

	* src/matpack*.{h,cc}: Moved implementation of iterator stuff into
	class definitions to get them inlined because we need maximum
	performance here.

	Removed reimplementation of 'operater() const' from the view classes
	and replaced them with a single 'using ConstXXXView::operator()'.
	This forces the compiler to call the correct const function for
	the non-const View classes. All in all, 254 function implementations
	removed from matpack.

	* src/matpackI.h: Fixed copy/paste error in last version.

	* src/xml_io.cc: Bug fixes to avoid possible use of uninitialized
	variables in try-catch-blocks.

2002-11-25  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-303

	* src/m_optproperties.cc: Renamed (m_scatproperties.cc) as this file
	now contains all workspace methods for calculating optical 
	properties, not only the scattering properties.

	* src/agendas.cc (opt_prop_gas_agenda): Corrected input and output 
	of this agenda.

2002-11-22  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-302

	* src/rte.cc/.h (rte_step): Created the general radiative transfer step
	function. The diagonal case I have taken from Patricks function 
	(rte_step_clearsky_with_emission). 
	Shifted (stokes_vecGeneral) from scat_rte.cc to this file. 

	* src/scat_rte.cc/.h: Removed these files. All radiative transfer 
	functions are now in rte.cc.

	* src/Makefile.am: Removed files above.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Modified (i_fieldUpdate1D), it uses the general
	RT function, now.

2002-11-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-301

	* configure.in: Fixed messed up CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS. Introduced new
	variable DEBUG_FLAGS.

2002-11-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-300

	* src/matpack*.{h,cc}, src/Makefile.am: Added cc files for matpack
	and moved implementation part. Otherwise, a compiler ignoring the
	inline keyword gets multiple defined symbols.

	NOTE: At the moment compilation is twice as fast as before. BUT there
	are some drawbacks in calculation speed because some frequently called
	functions (iterator stuff) have to be moved back to the header file to
	be inlined again.

	* configure.in: Increased template depth to 40 to get non-debug
	compiles working.
	Use CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS from environment variable also in debug mode. For
	basic optimizations set CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to something like:

	export CFLAGS="-O2 -march=i686"
	export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"

	Rerun autogen.sh afterwards.
	For maximum performance try something like:

	export CFLAGS=" -O2 -march=i686 -fforce-addr -funroll-loops
	-frerun-cse-after-loop -frerun-loop-opt -falign-functions=4
	-fomit-frame-pointer -fexpensive-optimizations"
	export CXXFLAGS="$CFLAGS"

	* ChangeLog: Removed arts-0-x-x history.

	* ChangeLog-0.x: Added. Moved pre-1.0 changelog entries here.

2002-11-22  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-299

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added the variables
	a_pressure, a_temperature, and a_vmr_list, which can hold the
	local pressure, temperature, and list of VMRs, respectively. They
	are intended for communication with agendas and methods
	calculating absorption coefficients.
	Also replaced gas_tgs by gas_species.

2002-11-21  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Modified functions which uses scat_rte_agenda -
	(i_fieldIterate) and (i_fieldUpdate1D).
	Included more checks and initialized all variables for the scattering
	calculations in the beginning of (i_fieldIterate), where they appear
	first.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Changed interface of methods above.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Included more checks.

2002-11-21  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-297

	Removed *ext_mat_gas*, *ext_mat_part*, *abs_vec_gas*, abs_vec_part*.
	Removed also *scat_f_index*. This variable is replaced by *f_index*.
	Included and removed entries for agendas (see agenda.cc).

	* src/methods.cc: Added:
		- ext_matAddGas
		- ext_matAddPart
		- abs_vecAddGas
		- abs_vecAddPart
	Removed: 
		- ext_mat_partCalc
		- abs_vec_partCalc
		- ext_mat_gasCalc
		- abs_vec_gasCalc
		- ext_mat_partScat
		- ext_mat_gasExample // Commented out the examples, may be we 
		- abs_vec_gasExample // can use them again.
	
	* src/agendas.cc: Added: 
		- scalar_gas_absorption_agenda
	        - opt_prop_gas_agenda
		- opt_prop_part_agenda
	Removed:
		- ext_mat_agenda
		- abs_vec_agenda
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Modified the (i_fieldIterate) and (i_fieldUpdate1D)
	according to the new variable definitions and new agenda definitions.
	Moved (stokes_vecGeneral) and (stokes_vecScalar) to the new file
	scat.rte.cc. These methods are ordinary functions now.
	*scat_rte_agenda* which can use only these functions, will be removed.
	Replaced *scat_f_index* by *f_index*.
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Replaced *scat_f_index* by f_index*.

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc:
 	Added:
		- ext_matAddGas
		- abs_vecAddGas
		These methods are only dummy functions, as the method
		scalar_gas_absExtractFromLookup is not yet implemented.
	
		- ext_matAddPart	
		- abs_vecAddPart
		These are only slightly modified versions of the former 
		methods *ext_mat_partCalc* and *abs_vec_partCalc*.
		
	Removed:
		- ext_mat_partCalc
		- abs_vec_partCalc
		- ext_mat_gasCalc
		- abs_vec_gasCalc
		These methods are replaced by the new method.
	
		- ext_mat_partScat
		This method was only used for the convergence test. I think
		we do not need it anymore. It does not work with the 
		modified variables, so I commented it out.
	
		- ext_mat_gasExample 
		- abs_vec_gasExample 
		Commented out the Examples. They also have to be modified if 
		they should work with the new variables.

	* src/scat_rte.cc/h: This file contains now the functions
	for a radiative step calculation with scattering integral term. 

	* src/Makefile.am: Included scat_rte.cc/h.

	* src/Makefile.am: Fixed typos gridded_field.h -> gridded_fields.h
	Removed no longer existent los.h.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/Makefile.am: Added fm_definitions, interpolation,
	polarization, ppath and scattering to SUBDIRS.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/{polarization,interpolation,scattering}/Makefile.am:
	Added missing Makefiles needed to build dist.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/{polarization,interpolation,scattering}/.cvsignore:
	Added.

	* configure.in: WARNING_FLAGS and -ftemplate-depth- are gcc specific.
	Therefore, they are now only set if gcc/g++ is in use, otherwise we
	break compilation with non-gnu compilers (e.g. HP/NEC).

	Added missing Makefiles needed to build dist.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc: Continued work on the lookup table. I
	have now a first implementation for the simple case without
	temperature interpolation. The next step is to test this.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Updated.

	* src/m_absorption.cc: Added. This should hold workspace methods
	related to the general calculation of absorption coefficients.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added gas_abs_lookup.

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): Added gas_abs_lookupInit.

	* src/special_interp.cc (z_at_lat_2d): Created this function.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_std_2d): Started on this function.

	(get_refr_index_2d): Created this function.

2002-11-18  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-293

	* src/ppath.cc (refraction_gradient_2d): Created this function.

	(ppath_step_refr_std_1d): Some improved comments.

	(ppath_start_2d): Moved some code from ppath_geom_2d and created this 
	function as this code will be common with functions for refraction.

2002-11-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-292

	* src/test_scatproperties.cc: Include cmath. Required on some
	systems (like marvin).

	* src/special_interp.cc: Include iostream for cout (GCC3).

	* doc/uguide/arts_methods_to_latex.sh: Workaround to get it working
	on marvin.

	* doc/doxygen/Makefile.am: File 'doxyfied' is now removed with make
	clean in maintainer-mode.

	----------

	Fixes for upcoming release 1.3 of doxygen. We have to care more about
	the format and tags we use in our comments because it contains now a
	validating parser instead of a lexical scanner.

	* src/parser.cc (eat_whitespace): @exceptions no longer exists, it is
	now called @exception.

	* src/old_absorption.cc (get_tagindex_for_Strings): Use <pre></pre>
	instead of verbatim environment.

	* src/partition_function_data.cc (spec): Use <pre>.
	Inserted missing end tags.

	* src/species_data.cc: Inserted missing end tags.

2002-11-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-291

	* src/special_interp.cc/h: Created these files and moved atmospheric
	interpolation functions to these files from interpolation.cc/h.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_std_1d): It seems that this function
	now works. So 1D with refaction should be finished. 
	This function is better than the corresponding function in arts-1.
	The tangent altitude is found with a better accuracy. The accuracy
	can be controled by a variable inside the function, which is now set
	to 0.1 m. The determination of the tangent altitude is not determined
	by the ray tracing step. 
	The maximum length of the ray tracing steps is now set by giving a 
	length. Small lengths can be used. I have tested steps down to 100m
	and it is very fast (as long as the calculation of refractive index is
	fast). However, some simple tests showed that step lengths below 1 km
	should not be needed (changing the ray tracing steps from 1 km to
	100m moved the tangent point about 250 m horisontally (for a tangent
	altitude close to ground), which should be compared to a total path
	length of many hundreds of km).

	(get_refr_index_1d): A temporary solution to get refractive index.
	The core function is taken from arts-1.

2002-11-15  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

2002-11-15  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-289

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (convergence_flagAbs): Modified iteration counter.
	After the scattering calculation for the first frequency has converged 
	it is set to 100. This number indicates then that the iterations 
	should no longer be printed in (Tensor6WriteIteration).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldSetClearsky): Initialization of i_field was
	missing.

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc

	I removed or commented the "cout"s, which we had included for 
	debugging.

2002-11-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-288

	* src/interpolation.cc (itw2p): Created this function to convert
	altitudes to pressures.
	
	(interp_atmsurface_XXXX and interp_atmfield_XXXX): Changed the name
	of the special functions to interpolate atmospheric fields and 
	surfaces, and changed the strategy somewhat. The following functions
	exist now (use them!):

           void interp_atm_field_gp2itw
           void interp_atmfield_by_itw
           void interp_atmfield_by_gp

           Numeric interp_atmsurface_by_gp

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepRefractionStd): The WSM to be used in the
	future for path calculations with refraction, using a basic/standard
	calculation approach.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_std_1d): Started on this core function 
	for 1D path calculations with refraction.

	* arts-1-1-284

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc (pha_matCalc): Bug fixed in this function. 
	The off-diagonal elements were calculated wrongly, now the whole phase 
	matrix is calculated correctly.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Only documentation.

2002-11-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-283

	* doc/doc++/Makefile.am, doc/doc++/html/Makefile.am,
	doc/doc++/tex/Makefile.am, doc/doc++/tex/docxx.sty: Removed.

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Remove uguide.ind after generating dvi/pdf
	to avoid conflict between latex and pdflatex.

2002-11-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-282

	* doc/uguide/uguide.tex: Use ifthen package to determine whether
	we are using pdflatex or vanilla latex. So, we don't need any
	longer the separate uguide_pdf.tex file.

	* doc/uguide/uguide_pdf.tex: Removed after merging into uguide.tex.

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Adapted to create both ps and pdf file 
	from uguide.tex.

	Moved several files from MAINTAINERCLEANFILES to CLEANFILES.
	Everything except uguide.{ps,pdf,dvi} and automatically
	generated tex files can be removed.

	Remove uguide.toc after creation of ps/pdf file because latex and
	pdflatex use different formats for this file.

	Use -o option for dvips instead of output redirection.

	* doc/uguide/.cvsignore: Cleanup.

	* src/Makefile.am: $(EXEEXT) was still missing in some places.

2002-11-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-281

	* configure.in: Version number correction.

2002-11-08  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-280

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Restructured this chapter. Also 
	included some functions which have not been documented so far.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Documentation.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Documentation.

2002-11-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-279

	* src/Makefile.am: Append $(EXEEXT) to overridden targets. This
	prevents automake 1.5/1.6 from outputting errors but leads to
	warnings emitted by automake 1.4. But hey, a warning is better than
	an error, right? ;-) And it has the advantage that 'make' stops on
	errors but continues on warnings. automake 1.7 also just works fine.

2002-11-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-278

	* configure.in: Use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE macro from automake instead
	of our homemade stuff. If --enable-maintainer-mode is used,
	additional dependencies are included in the generated Makefiles.
	E.g. when configure.in or any Makefile.am are changed the
	Makefiles are rebuild automatically with the next make. This
	is not necessary for end-users. --enable-maintainer-mode is
	passed by default to configure when you call autogen.sh.

	IMPORTANT NOTE: Dependency check on configure.in is only performed
	in top level directory. This means: After an update or modifying
	configure.in you *MUST* run make in the top level directory.

	Debugging is activated in maintainer-mode by default and disabled
	in end-user mode. This could be overridden by passing --enable-debug
	or --disable-debug to configure.

	Removed setting of arts-data path on smiles pcs to lookup2. Moved to
	autogen.sh because configure should not contain such special
	treatments.

	Cleanup. Removed some unused macros.

	* autogen.sh: Inserted hostname check and pass
	--with-arts-data=/pool/lookup2/arts-data to configure if we
	are on a smiles pc.

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am, doc/doxygen/Makefile.am: Use
	MAINTAINER_MODE in conditional.

	* .cvsignore: Added autom4te.cache. Sorted.

2002-11-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-277

	* src/xml_io.cc (ArtsXMLTag::read_from_stream): Skip
	<comment></comment> blocks. Comments are only allowed to be put
	directly after the <arts> tag or in front of the </arts> tag.

2002-11-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-276

	* src/xml_io.cc: Added io routines for SpeciesTag, ArrayOfSpeciesTag,
	ArrayOfArrayOfSpeciesTag.
	Reading/writing of SpeciesTag writes only the empty tags because the
	implementation part of SpeciesTag is not yet done.
	Moved function declarations and template instantations to
	xml_io_private.h.

	* src/absorption.h: Added type ArrayOfSpeciesTag. At the moment, this
	type is only used to define ArrayOfArrayOfSpeciesType to keep
	consistency with the way ArraysOfArrays are defined in arts.

	* src/xml_io_private.h: Added. Separated function declarations and
	template instantiations from implementation part.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added xml_io_private.h in several places.

2002-11-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-275

	* autogen.sh: Cleanup. Added --gnu option to automake.

	* configure.in: Added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE.

	* absorption.h, m_abs.cc, old_absorption.cc, workspace.cc, xml_io.cc:
	Renamed OneTag to SpeciesTag.

	* absorption.h, gas_abs_lookup.h, groups.cc, m_abs.cc,
	m_clonesize.cc, old_absorption.cc, workspace.cc, xml_io.cc:
	Renamed TagGroups to ArrayOfArrayOfSpeciesTag.

	* src/m_xml.h, src/xml_io.h: Cleanup.

	* src/xml_io.cc: Started to add io routines for GasAbsLookup.

	these new lineshapes, the Voigt-Kuntz approximation with relative
	accuracy better than 2*10^-6 and the Voigt-Drayson one.

	* src/methods.cc: Added the respective descriptions for these 
	lineshapes.
	
2002-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-270

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_1d): Added a call of
	gridpos_force_end_fd for path steps ending on a pressure surface.
	The function was not working without this call.

	* ami/xml/xmlReadArray: Bug fixes.

	* ami/xml/xmlReadTensor[3-5]: Added.

	* ami/xml/xmlCheckSize: Added. Checks whether the number of read data
	item corresponds to the intended number.

	* ami/xml/xmlReadTensor6, ami/xml/xmlReadMatrix: Corrected permutation
	of input vector.

	NOTE: The function name which is called for reading a data type from
	an XML file is put together in xmlLoad.m. So, for every new data type
	only a file called xmlRead<DATATYPE>.m has to be put into the
	directory.  Array and ArrayOfArray are working automatically
	(hopefully).
	
	WARNING: All implemented reading routines work as long as the input
	file is correct. There is currently nearly no error checking. All
	kinds of strange things may happen.

	* arts-1-1-243

	* There have been rather big changes for the clear sky RTE part.
	Some comments are given below. However, as I am the only one working
	with this part I am saving the energy to later to describe the RTE
	part in a good way in AUG and the online documentation.

	The problems I encountered for the ground reflections made me think
	in somewhat new ways, and voila, I found a new and better structure
	for the calculations. So right now I am happy.

	The RTE part is now rather complete, but I have only done practical
	tests for a few simple cases. So much bug checking is to be done.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd) and (RteCalc): The functions are to a
	large extent restructured. Several tasks have been lifted from 
	rte_agenda functions (where RteEmissionStd is the only existing one so
	far) which is an advantage. The task of rte_agenda methods is now much
	clearer. 
	The restructuring made it possible to call RteCalc in a recursive way.
	This was needed to handle ground reflections following the new
	approach. In fact, the appraoch for ground reflections could be 
	followed to make scattering calculations in another way (which however
	would require changes to the ppath calculations). It is my hope
	that this approach will allow calculation of weighting functions 
	without to much problems (the first task will be to fix WFs with
	a scattering ground).

	* src/rte.cc (get_radiative_background): The old function 
	set_to_radiative_background has been renamed and to large parts been
	rewritten. All cases execpt when the path starts inside the cloud box
	are now handled (but not tested).
	
	(rte_step_clearsky_with_emission): This function was created before
	last commit but I forgot to mention it. This function makes an 
	automatic switch to the best way to calculate the matrix exponential.
	Shall a simialr function be made for the cloud box?
	That is, there is no agenda for this for the clear sky part.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (GroundTreatAsBlackbody): Created this function.
	This is the first function implemented for ground_refl_agenda.

	* src/interpolation.cc (gridpos_copy): Created this function to copy
	a GridPos.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxOff): The function now also sets 
	scat_i_p, scat_i_lat, scat_i_lon, scat_za_grid and scat_aa_grid to be
	empty. This is needed as the variables must be input to RteCalc.

	(CloudboxGetOutgoing): Added to cloudbox_on is input to check that the
	cloud box is actually turned on. Added also a check that scat_za_grid
	not is empty, which would be the case if CloudboxOff is called and
	later cloudbox_on is set to 1 but no cloud box calculations have been
	performed. 
	
	Claudia, should some more safety checks be added? The header of the
	file is not updated since the re-naming of the function.

2002-09-16  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-242

	* src/***: The WSV blackbody_ground is removed. It caused many and
	problematic dependencies between WSVs. Ground reflections will also
	be handled in a different way and there is no longer a big need for
	blackbody_ground.
	This means that there is no constrain now for placing the cloud box.
	It is up to the user to decide if it is OK to have a gap between the
	ground and the cloud box.

	* src/m_ppath and ppath: The fields ground, i_ground, symmetry and 
	i_symmetry are removed from the Ppath structure. 
	The calculation of a propagation path now stops at all intersections
	with the ground. 
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Removed the WSV t_ground and e_ground, and the
	corresponding agendas.
	Introduced new variables for handling ground reflections: 
	ground_refl_agenda, ground_emission, ground_los and ground_refl_coeffs.

	* src/m_rte and rte: Removed old ground variables and started to
	incorporate the new ones. 

2002-09-16  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-240

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (CloudboxGetOutgoing): Changed the name of the 
	method. Earlier it was (y_scatCalc). Changed the interface of the
	function. *cloudbox_los* and *cloudbox_los* are removed, instead of
	these variables there are the gridpositions *a_gp_p*, *a_gp_lat*,
	*a_gp_lon* and *a_los* for the direction. The 3D part is still 
	missing.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed WSVs *y_scat*, *cloudbox_pos* and 
	*cloudbox_los*. Added WSVs *a_gp_p*, *a_gp_lat* and *a_gp_lon*.

	returns the spectrum after a scattering calculation on the cloudbox
	boundary for given position and direction.
	(i_fieldSetConst): Generalized this method. Now you can specify 
	differnt values for each Stokes component of i_field inside 
	the cloudbox.

	* src/workspace.cc: Included the variables *y_scat*, *cloudbox_pos*
	and *cloudbox_los* for the method *y_scatCalc*.

	* src/methods.cc: Added *y_scatCalc*.

	taken from inputs themselves. Now more checks are also included.  

	* src/methods.cc : Adapted all the methods calculating scattering
	properties to include stokes_dima as input.   

	* src/agendas.cc : Changed the online documentation for
	ext_mat_agenda and abs_vec_agenda.  Earlier there was a
	misunderstanding because they were not looking like examples.
	Patrick had pointed out this some time back.

2002-09-09  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-233

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Changed the calculation of the 
	planck function for one layer. Now the mean of the temperature is
	calculated first and afterwards the planck function.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (scat_iPut): Included this method. It puts the 
	scattered radiation field into the interface variables between 
	cloudbox and clearsky calculations.
	(i_fieldSetClearsky), (i_fieldSetConst): Shifted these methods here, 
	because they have nothing to do with scattering properties.

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc: Shifted the two methods above.

	* src/methods.cc: Included entry for scat_iPut.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (scat_fieldCalc): Bug fixed. The scattering
	intergral was only calculated for 180° zenith angle, because 
	because *pha_mat_spt* was not calculated in this function.
	(i_fieldUpdate1D): Fixed another bug here. Insted of I_0 on the 
	gridpoints layer mean values were taken.

	* src/methods.cc: Modified interface for (scat_fieldCalc).

	* arts-1-1-221

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Bug Fixed. The absorption 
	vector was only calculated for one direction. Before 
	abs_vec_sptCalc we have to call pha_mat_sptCalc in the same loop. 
	So I also had to modify the interface of the function, pha_mat_spt
	must not be declared as constant.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (Tensor6WriteIteration), (convergence_flagAbs): 
	Moved the iteration counter to convergence_flagAbs. Now it should 
	be posible to print out scat_field and i_field at the same time.

	* src/methods.cc: Modified entry for i_fieldUpdate1D.

	* arts-1-1-213

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Modified this function to get
	boundary conditions right. Some loops are rearranged so that the 
	function is more efficient. The values of the zenith angles are taken 
	as criterion for upward or downward propagation.
	The special case (zenith angle a bit higher than 90°) is still not 
	included. Here the first intersection point is at the same altitude
	as the initial point.

	* src/Makefile.am (test_interpolation_SOURCES): Copy list of
	sources from arts_SOURCES (Without main.cc on second try :-))
	because we nearly need everything here.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc (test01): Don't define joker class.

2002-08-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-211

	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Added #include <stdio.h> to nmake sprintf known.

	* src/m_physics.cc: Added this file and moved methods for conversion
	to Tb to this file.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_not_empty): Added this function to give
	an error if an agenda is empty (that should never be alowed, or?).
	This function is now called in "my parts" before an agenda is used.

	The inclusion of agendas in check_input has made that 
	test_interpolation cannot now be linked. I started to add files to
	the sources for test_interpolation, but I just needed to add more.

	What to do? Can test interpolation be removed?

	* src/rte.cc: Added header to the functions in the file. Note 
	especially the function ground_reflection_with_emission that is
	intended as a general function to call to consider ground reflections
	with emission.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): The function now uses *t_field*
	to determine the temperature along the propagation path.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): The function has been slightly modified as
	a preperation to include Hb. 

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: The existing text, beside part on
	ground reflections, has been revised and adapted to changes in the
	source code.

	* arts-1-1-210
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc: Added the method *Tensor6ToTbByPlanck* and
	removed the method i_fieldtoTb.  This
	is a Generic method following yesterday's discussion.  But the
	frequency grid is taken as specific input.  This is because,
	inside cloudbox we have only one frequency which is specified by
	the variable scat_f_index.  And mostly intensity fields inside the
	cloudbox only are Tensor6. 

	* src/methods.cc : Added the method Tensor6ToTbByPlanck and
	removed the method i_fieldtoTb.

	* doc/examples/i_field_example.i_field_Tb.xml : Removed this
	output file following ARTS convention of not including the output
	files. 

	* doc//examples/i_field_example.arts.in : Usage of Generic method
	Tensor6ToTbByPlanck instead of i_fieldtoTb.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldtoTb): This method converts the i_field
	in radiance units to Planck brightness temperature.  This uses the
	function *invplanck* in physics_funcs.cc 

	* src/methods.cc : Added the method i_fieldtoTb.

	* src/workspace.cc : Added the workspace variable i_field_Tb.

	* doc/examples/clearskyfield.xml : This is an example file added
	to give realistic input to the interface at cloudbox boundaries.
	This is created from ARTS.1.0.  The boundaries in pressure
	altitudes are 360 hPa and 280 hPa.

	* doc/examples/i_field_example.arts.in : The cloudbox boundary is
	changed to 360 hPa and 280 hPa. The example can now read the
	interface field from the above file.  The pnd_field is changed
	from 1 to a more realistic value 1297m^(-3).  The example file was
	giving a decent output until the last update.  After the last
	update the i_field is giving 0 and nan at some places because of
	which I cannot run this example.  But for having a look at the
	initial result I have a copy of the result in my smiles_local
	which I can add to the repositary which can be removed later.  

	* doc/examples/i_field_example.i_field_Tb.xml : This is the
	i_field in brightness temperature unit for 4 pressure grids(2 at
	cloudbox boundary and 2 inside the cloud box) inside
	the cloudbox.

	* arts-1-1-206	
		
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Included cloudbox boundary 
		conditions. Radiation travelling out of the cloudbox is 
		defined to be 0 as it is not needed for the iterations.
		
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (stokes_vecGeneral): Bug fixed.

	* src/test_linalg.cc (test_lusolve1D): Added this function to see
		if the LU decomposition also works for scalar equations.

	* configure.in: While checking in last time, I edited  cd .. in
	this file by mistake.  

	* doc/examples/i_field_example.arts.in : Forgot to add this file to
	the repository.

	* doc/examples/Makefile.am : Forgot to add this in the list
	arts_examples 

2002-08-15  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-204

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc (abs_vec_gasExample): Added this
	method.  This method is implemented for test purposes.  It is
	necessary to have some realistic values of absorption coefficents
	for radiative transfer calculations. The absorption coefficients
	calculated using ARTS.1.0 are used in this method and they are
	interpolated onto the pressure grid used for RT calculations.

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc (ext_mat_gasExample): This method is
	also for facilitating test calculations.  This gives extinction
	matrix for gaseous species.  The diagonal elements are the
	absorption coefficients calculated from abs_vec_gasExample and the
	off-diagonal elements are zero.  

	* src/methods.cc : Added the above two methods with minimum
	documentations. 
	
	* doc/examples/i_field_example.arts : This is an example control
	file which can be used to test the scattering RT calculation.
	
2002-08-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-203

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): Pieces of this function have been 
	lifted out to be functions in rte.cc. This to make it easier to make
	other verions of methods for rte_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: The variable *e_ground* is now a matrix to allow
	more elaborated treatments of ground reflections later.

	* To summerize. The ground is now included in the RTE part. Spectra
	can be produced, but only for dummy atmospheric temperature and 
	absorption. No connection with the cloud box yet.

2002-08-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-202

	* src/workspace.cc: New WSV is mblock_index. The usage of a_pos and 
	a_los has been extended.

	* src/agendas.cc: New agenda is i_space_agenda.

	* src/methods.cc: New WSM are VectorToTbByRJ, VectorToTbByPlanck,
	MatrixToTbByRJ and MatrixToTbByPlanck.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): Adopted to i_space_agenda.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (integer_div): New function.

	* src/logic.cc (is_multiple): New function.

2002-08-09  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-201
	
	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): The changes made here are
	mainly with reference to the size of i_field and scat_field.  This
	comes in all methods which use these variables.  For example, In
	the previous version the size of i_field was 
	i_field( N_p, N_lat, N_lon, N_za, N_aa, N_i ) whereas now it is
	changed to i_field( cloudbox_limits[1] - cloudbox_limits[0]) +1,
       		        ( cloudbox_limits[3] - cloudbox_limits[2]) +1,
       			( cloudbox_limits[5] - cloudbox_limits[4]) +1,
       			 N_za, N_aa, N_i ).
	The code doesn't look very clean now because i have commented some
	parts of the code for Claudia to have a look at the changes i have
	made because she has written them.

	I had quite lot of problem at cloudbox boundaries while taking the
	average of *i_field* and *scat_field*.  That part has to be for
	sure rewritten.  But at present I retain them and comments on it
	will be really helpful.  

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (i_fieldIterate):There is some change in the
	input to *i_fieldIterate* which I forgot to enter in the Changelog
	file earlier.  The new input added to this method is scat_aa_grid.

	* src/m_scatrte.cc (scat_fieldCalc): Some bugs are fixed, as usual.

	* src/methods.cc : Changed inputs to i_fieldIterate.

	* src/workspace.cc : Changed the dimensions of i_field,
	i_field_old and scat_field.  Change the usage of amp_mat as output
	from amp_matCalc

2002-08-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-200

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): This function should now be ready. 

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteEmissionStd): The first attempt to create a
	method for rte_agenda.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc (VectorToTbByRJ): Started on this function. Not yet 
	ready.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yNoPolarisation): Created this function.

	* Polished on descriptions for included agendas, variables and methods.

	* The rather frequent commits depend on that I work both on the desktop
	and the laptop.

2002-08-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-199

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): Introduced some new variables and agendas

	* arts-1-1-194

	* src/math_funcs.cc (AngIntegrate_trapezoid): Fixed bugs in this
	routine. 

	* scatproperties.cc : Again, fixed some bugs, mainly related to
	units of amplitude matrix, phase matrix and cross-sections. Tested
	the routines by reading in real values from the data base and it
	seems now that the calculation of scattering properties is
	correct.  I verified it with our old calculations when stokes_dim
	is equal to 1.  

2002-07-26  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>
	
	* arts-1-1-193
	
	* src/m_scatproperties.cc (i_fieldSet): This methods interpolates
	the radiation field on all grid points inside the cloud box from
	the clear sky field.    This is the first guess for the iterative
	solution method.  The method is successfully tested for a 1-D case
	and hope that it works for 3-D too. 
	
	* src/methods.cc : Included the method i_fieldSet.
	
	* src/workspace.cc : Some minor corrections in the description of 
	scat_i_p and scat_i_lon.  
	
	* doc/examples : In the control file i_field.arts, added the path
	name for amplitude matrix data file.  But this data file cannot be
	used, as it has only one frequency and interpolation cannot be
	done if the old grid has only one point.  I made a new data file
	with more than one frequency and I am presently working with it
	for testing the scattering routines.  That data file is not at
	present in the package arts-data.  
	
2002-07-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-192

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_1d): Made a new version of this 
	function, using the same approach as in the same function for 2D. The
	code of the function is now much shorter and easier to understand.
	
	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_2d): Fixed one bug. 

	* The 1D and 2D functions give the same result, for cases when this 
	shall be the case. The both functions are now hopefully finished.

	* arts-1-1-184

	* src/ppath.cc: More work on 2D geoemtrical propagation paths.

2002-06-14  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-137
	
	* src/scatproperties.cc : completed the functions amp2ext,
	amp2pha,amp2abs called by ext_mat_sptCalc, pha_mat_sptCalc
	and abs_vec_sptCalc respectively.  Added more documentation
	in the comment.  Also the new routine for solid angle integration
	of Matrix is included here. I think it is better to shift this
	function to math_funcs.cc or so.   

2002-06-14  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-136

	* src/methods.cc: Included methods for RT with scattering:
	(stokes_vecGeneral) General computaion of the RTE, works for all 
	Stokes dimensions.
	(stokes_vecScalar) Special function which is more efficient for 
	computing the scalar RTE.

	* src/agendas.cc (scat_rte_agenda): Agenda to compute the RT inside
	the cloudbox.

	* src/workspace.cc: Included workspace variables for the methods
	above:
	- stokes_vec
	- l_step
	- planck_function
	- ext_mat
	- abs_vec
	- sca_vec

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: (stokes_vecGeneral) and (stokes_vecScalar)
	added. (i_fieldIterate) and (i_fieldUpdate1D) modified so that
	(scat_rte_agenda) can be executed.

	* doc/examples/i_field.arts: This example executes now
	*ppath_step_agenda* and *scat_rte_agenda*).

	* src/cloudbox.cc/h: No functions are left here at the moment.

	* src/Makefile.am: Removed cloudbox.cc/h from arts_SOURCES.
	
2002-06-13  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	 src/cloudbox.h,
	 src/lin_alg.cc,
	 src/lin_alg.h,
	 src/m_cloudbox.cc,
	 src/test_linalg.cc: Formatted the files according to Olivers
	 remarks on coding style.

2002-06-11  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-131

	* General: Implemented automatic Input/Output checking for
	agendas. That means, you no longer have to check in the calling
	function that the agenda does what it is supposed to do. There is
	now a special lookup table for agendas in file agendas.cc. Data
	records for new agendas have to be added in both workspace.cc and
	agendas.cc, however, the DESCRIPTION in workspace.cc should just
	be a reference to agendas.cc. Only the DESCRIPTION in agendas.cc
	is used by arts -d etc..
	
	* src/agendas.cc: Added. This contains the lookup data for
	agendas. You have to edit this everytime you add an agenda. But
	nevertheless, you also have to add an entry in
	workspace.cc. Documentation for the agenda must be in agendas.cc,
	not in workspace.cc.

	* src/agenda_record.h: Added.

	* src/agenda_record.cc: Added.

	* src/agenda_class.h: Added.

	* src/agenda_class.cc: Added.

	* src/agenda.h: Moved to agenda_class.h.

	agenda_record.cc for technical reasons.

	* src/workspace.cc: Moved agenda DESCRIPTIONS to agendas.cc for
	all agendas that have been defined so far.

	* src/parser.h: Changed name of agenda header file to agenda_class.h.

	* src/methods.cc: Updated copyright notice, updated documentation
	for AgendaSet.

	* src/make_auto_wsv_h.cc: Changed name of agenda header file to agenda_class.h.

	* src/main.cc: Made command line switches work for agendas.

	* src/m_agenda.cc: Made AgendaSet check the input and output parameters.

	* src/globals_2.cc: Added AgendaMap.

2002-06-11  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-130

	* src/m_cloudboc.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Extended the function such
	that it adapts automatically to the scalar case if *stokes_dim* is
	set to 1.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (sto_vec1DCalc): Added this function to do the
	scalar radiative transfer calculation.

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Included the scalar RTE as a special
	case. 
	
2002-06-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-129

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Rewritten the part for radiative
	transfer inside the cloudbox to document the already existing
	functions. 

	* doc/uguide/lin_alg.tex: Replaced \verb by \artsstyle.

2002-06-10  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-128

	* src/m_scatproperties.cc: Added this file.  This has so far the
	workspace methods ext_mat_sptCalc,pha_mat_sptCalc and 
	abs_vec_sptCalc.  Some changes are for sure expected in these
	methods.  

	* src/methods.cc: Added the methods ext_mat_sptCalc,
	pha_mat_sptCalc and abs_vec_sptCalc. 

	* src/Makefile.am : included in the source file list
	m_scatproperties.cc,scatproperties.cc and scatproperties.h
	
2002-06-10  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-127

	* src/workspace.cc : Added the workspace variables scat_za_index
	and scat_aa_index necessary for the methods used for calculating
	scattering properties of particles.

2002-06-08  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-126

	* src/workspace.cc: Added some #defines (NAME, DESCRIPTION,
	GROUP), so that this file is now formated similar to methods.cc. The
	main reason why I did this is because I wanted to add fields
	OUTPUT and INPUT to list output and input WSVs for
	agendas. However, it turns out that this problem cannot be solved
	so easily. The problem is this: The enum type for the different
	WSVs (ls_, f_grid_, etc.) is defined in auto_wsv.h, which is
	generated from workspace.cc. So, using the enum inside
	workspace.cc would generate a circular dependency. I played around
	with some tricks to solve this, but they all made things very
	complicated. So, my preferred solution at the moment is to add an
	extra file agendas.cc, which will contain agenda lookup
	data. Agendas will then have to be registered in two files, both
	workspace.cc and agendas.cc.

	* src/methods.h: Moved the #defines for OUTPUT, etc., to methods.cc.

	* src/methods.cc: Moved the #defines for OUTPUT, etc., here from
	methods.h. 

2002-06-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-125

	* src/ppath.cc (psurface_crossing_2d): Adapted the Matlab function
	psurface_crossing in AMI to create this function. I had to handle
	the case c=0 especially due to a limitation of poly_root_solve
	compared to the Matlab function roots. 
	Tests performed of the function and it looked OK.

2002-06-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-124

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Changed header for \typeindex from "data
	structures" to "data types". Added \include for app_groups.tex.

	* doc/uguide/matrix_vector.tex: Replaced \verb by \artsstyle. Added
	some index commands.

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Replaced \verb by \artsstyle. Added
	some index commands.

	* doc/uguide/app_groups.tex: Added this file. It lists all WSV
	groups. 

	* doc/uguide/arts_groups_to_latex.sh: Added this script (written
	by Oliver), which puts the output of arts -g into LaTeX commands.

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Added target auto_groups.tex, which is
	generated by the arts_groups_to_latex.sh script. Added variable
	$(autotexfiles), which now holds only auto_groups.tex.
	NOTE: If you try to build in doc/uguide with a pristine ARTS
	package (after make maintainer-clean at toplevel), you will now
	get an error message, because the arts executable is needed to
	generate auto_groups.tex. If you say make at toplevel, src is
	built first, so there is no problem.

	* doc/uguide/.cvsignore: Added auto_groups.tex.

	* src/main.cc (main): Changed output stream for --help and
	--version options from cerr to cout. Also, removed "This is" from
	--version output.

	* src/.cvsignore: Added test_scatproperties.

2002-06-07  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-123

	* src/methods.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): Included this method to update
	the intensity field during the iteration. Performs RT calculation 
	with fixed scattered field.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_fieldUpdate1D): This function was in
	cloudbox.cc before. Now it uses the *ppath_step_agenda*, for this
	reason it is a workspace method now. 

	* src/cloudbox.cc (i_field_update1D): Removed this function.

	* src/workspace.cc: Included WSV *scat_field* and *i_field_old*.

	* doc/examples/i_field_arts: Example to test the cloudbox functions.

	work. Some results are now printed on the screen.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Sensor position and LOS printed as out2.

2002-06-06  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-121	

	* src/test_scatproperties.cc: Renamed
	src/test_opt_properties.cc to test_scatproperties.cc to be 
	consistent.

	* src/workspace.cc: corrected the dimension of pha_mat_spt.

2002-06-06  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-120

	* src/workspace.cc: Included workspace variable amp_mat_raw.
		
	* src/physics_funcs.cc: Modified functions again, so that they 
	return numeric values. 

	* src/m_rte.cc and cloudbox.cc: Adjusted to the new Planck
	function.

2002-06-06  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-119

	* src/scatproperties.cc : Added this file.  This contains some
	auxiliary functions like amp2ext,amp2pha,amp2abs which is called 
	by the workspace methods like ext_mat_sptCalc,pha_mat_sptCalc and
	abs_vec_sptCalc( Adding these methods is my immediate task.)

	* src/scatproperties.h : Added this file
	
	* src/test_opt_properties.cc (main): I added this file mainly 
	to test the scattering routines in scatproperties.cc

2002-06-05  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-118

	* doc/uguide/agendas.tex: Continued to work on this.

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Added references to the WSV, WSM,
	and agendas chapter in howtos.

	* src/agenda.h: Added set_name() and name() member functions to
	class Agenda, also added private member mname.

	* src/agenda.cc: Added implementation of set_name() and name().

	* src/main.cc: Set name for Main agenda.

	* src/parser.cc (parse_method): Removed duplicate level 3
	output. Cleaned up agenda output.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Replace "function" by "method".

	* arts-1-1-117
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Added workspace variables, ext_mat_spt,
	pha_mat_spt, and abs_vec_spt.  

2002-06-05  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-116

	* doc/uguide/agendas.tex: Started this file. It contains
	documentations about WSVs, WSMs, and particularly agendas. By
	doing this I noticed that WSM are sometimes called "workspace
	methods" and sometimes "workspace functions". But names should be
	consistent within AUG. Method is the older and more established
	term (that's for example why WSM files are called
	m_something.cc). So, I tried to enforce "method"
	everywhere. Please use the name "method" in future.

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Renamed \structindex to \typeindex, as
	suggested by Sreerekha/Patrick. Replaced "workspace functions" by
	"workspace methods". Replaced \wsfindex by \wsmindex.

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Replaced \wsfindex by \wsmindex.
	Replaced \wsmindex by \wsvindex for agendas, since agendas are
	WSVs, not WSMs. Replaced \wsmindex by \funcindex for matrix_exp,
	since this is a normal function, not a WSM. I suspect there are
	more functions marked by \wsmindex that really should be marked by
	\funcindex.

	* doc/uguide/lin_alg.tex: Replaced \wsfindex by \wsmindex.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Replaced "workspace functions" by
	"workspace methods". Replaced \wsfindex by \wsmindex.

	* doc/uguide/concept.tex: Replaced "functions" by "methods".

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Renamed \structindex to \typeindex, as
	suggested by Sreerekha/Patrick. Replaced "workspace functions" by
	"workspace methods". Replaced \wsfindex by \wsmindex.

	* doc/uguide/interpolation.tex: Renamed \structindex to \typeindex, as
	suggested by Sreerekha/Patrick.

	* src/ppath.cc: Just some small steps forward for 2D. Status basically
	as for last commit from me.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Polished the text. I happen to do this
	on the same time as Christian did his changes below and this caused
	a number of conflicts when updating. I hope that I managed to keep your
	changes Christian. 

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Polished the text. Conflicts as above.

2002-06-04  Christian Melsheimer  <melsheimer@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-113

	* doc/examples/absorption_example.arts.in: The first agenda
	example works! Method lsWithCutoffAdd uses agenda els_agenda to
	compute the elementary lineshape.

	* src/methods.cc: Modified IO parameters of elsLorentz and
	lsWithCutoffAdd. 

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Introduced els, the WSV to
	hold the output of the els_agenda.

	* src/m_lineshapes.cc: Finished lsWithCutoffAdd.

	* src/interpolation.cc (interp): Added to all interp functions an
	assert that makes sure that the sum of all weights for the first
	interpolated value is 1. This condition should be fulfilled for
	all the weights, of course, but we check only the first set of
	weights.

	* arts-1-1-112

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (i_field_itCalc): The method can be compiled and 
	tested using dummy variables for the scattering coefficients. But so
	far it only performs the update of the i_field for the 
	1D case.

	* src/workspace.cc: Changed amp_mat from Tensor7 to Tensor6. The 
	frequency dimension is taken out.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Changed amp_mat as input variable for  
	(i_field_itCalc).
	
	* src/physics_funcs.cc (planck): Fixed a bug here.

	   psurface_tilt_2D
	   is_los_downwards_2D
	   angle_after_ground_2D

	* src/m_ppath.cc: Two now WSF:

2002-05-31  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-110

	* Uff. I had some trouble resolving conflicts in workspace.cc. I
	seems that resorting this file (and methods.cc) was not such a
	great idea, since it leads to a lot of conflicts.
	
	* Started to work out agenda examples for lineshapes. Ran into a
	lot of problems (not so much related to the agendas, more to the
	lineshapes themselves). Nothing's working yet.

	* src/m_lineshapes.cc: Added.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added some lineshape variables.

	* src/methods.cc: Added some lineshape related methods. 
	(define_md_data): Removed abs_ from RteCalc input, following
	advice by Patrick. 
	(define_md_data): Replace "Global" by "Generic" everywhere.

	* src/groups.cc (define_wsv_group_names): Removed ArrayOfLineshapeSpec.

	* src/absorption.cc: Removed all contents to old_absorption.cc.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added new source files.

	* doc/examples/absorption_example.arts.in: My playing field for
	agenda based absorption routines.

	* src/m_rte.cc (RteCalc): Removed abs input, following advice by
	Patrick.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Started to include 2D cases.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Polished old text and wrote some pages of new 
	text. The chapter is now up to date with what has been implemented. 

	* doc/uguide: Made new versions of figures created by Latex commands.
	The new figures are made in xfig. So there should now not be any errors
	due to this when making uguide_pdf.

2002-05-31  Sreerekha T.R.  <rekha@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-108
	
	* doc/uguide/interpolation.tex: introduced the index commands which

	* src/test_xml.cc (main): Added exception handler.

2002-05-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-104

	* Things fixed for this commit, or in 1-1-99:
	
	* Some workspace functions have been renamed. 
	  - The PrintXxx functions now ends with Pring, e.g. NumericPrint.
	  - The functions to set the atmospheric dimensionality are now called
	    AtmosphereSet1D etc.
	This to follow our naming scheme better.
	
	* New workspace functions:

	* Improved the out-messages from some functions, especially in 
	m_basic_types, but there is more to do here.

	* Started on the RTE part, but found it hard before the agendas are
	ready. So I leave this for the moment.

 	transfer calculation with fixed scattering vector.	

	* src/linalg.cc/.h: (id_mat) Changed name of the function which 
	returns the identity matrix, as there was a conflict with another
	internal function named identity.

	* arts-1-1-92

	* Further work on propagation path calculations. Fixed numerous bugs.
	A simple upward 1D case works now at least. But more bugs to find.

	The biggest problem was to catch when the limited numerical precsion
	causes the fractional distance to be just below 0 or just above 1.

2002-05-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-91

	no bigger test runs yet. Tests for 2D cannot be made before a
	*ppath_step* function covering 2D exists.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_1d_geom): Started on this function.

2002-05-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

2002-05-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-83
	
	*** ASCII XML reading/writing ready for bug hunting :-) ***
	
	* src/groups.cc (define_wsv_group_names): Added Tensor4-7.

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data): Added reading/writing methods
	for Tensor3-7.

	* src/xml_io.{h,cc}: Moved all xml_read_from_stream function
	prototypes to cc file because there are not needed externally.

	Send debug output to out2 instead of cout.

	ArrayOfIndex, ArrayOfMatrix, ArrayOfString, ArrayOfVector, Index,
	Numeric, Matrix, String, Tensor3-7, Vector reading and writing
	works now.

	*** Still under development *** Reading only works for Numeric and
	Index at the moment. *** Documentation still missing in most
	parts.

2002-05-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-81
	
	* src/xml_io.{h,cc}: Implemented XML parser.

	To read the XML header I implemented a template function. Which
	reduces the number of needed read_from_file functions from n
	(n = Number of data types) to 1. From there the overloaded
	function read_from_stream is called to do the data type specific
	part.

	Currently there's only Index and Numeric ASCII read support. ASCII
	write support will follow, binary later.

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data): Corrected indentation of XML
	functions.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added two general vector variables vector1 and
	vector2.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc: Added the WSF MatrixFillWithVector and

	preprocessor token.

	* src/arts.h: Added 'using namespace std' to fix compile errors
	with newer, more ansi-compliant gccs (3.1).

	Include sstream instead of sstream.h for the same reason.

	* src/matpackI.h (Range): Default arguments for parameters are
	only allowed to be declared once. Removed from implementation
	part.

	* src/methods_aux.cc (PrintTemplate): Removed default for second
	parameter from implementation part.
	
	* src/mystring.h: Include climits.

	* src/main.cc,
	src/m_abs.cc,
	src/absorption.cc: Include algorithm.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc,
	src/test_linalg.cc,
	src/test_tensor.cc,
	src/test_poly.cc,
	src/test_matpack.cc,
	src/methods.h,
	src/poly_roots.cc,
	src/parameters.cc,
	src/make_auto_wsv_groups_h.cc,
	src/messages.h: Include iostream, otherwise cerr and cout are
	undeclared.

	* src/exceptions.h (ParseError): Added dummy virtual destructor
	including missing throw().

	* src/messages.cc: Rename global variable basename to out_basename
	to avoid a conflict with the basename function from the new string
	standard include file.

	* src/m_hdf.cc (filename_bin),
	src/main.cc (main),
	src/m_abs.cc (linesWriteAscii),
	src/m_abs.cc (lines_per_tgWriteAsci),
	src/file.cc (filename_ascii): Renamed basename to out_basename.

	* src/mystring.h (my_basic_string),
	src/array.h: Added keyword typename to several definitions
	(e.g. typename Array<base>::const_iterator xi;)

2002-05-08  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-68

	* src/interpolation.cc: 2D Green interpolation works.

	* src/interpolation.h: Added headers for new functions.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc: Test case for this.

	* src/logic.cc: Added is_size functions for tensors up to rank 7.

	* src/logic.h: Added headers for new functions.

2002-05-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-67

	* src/m_basic_types.cc: Created this file and moved the relevant 
	functions from m_io.cc. The revision of the functions is not 
	finished. Several functions are already removed. 

	* src/m_general.cc: Created this file and moved Exit and Test to the 
	file.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Created this file. No functions in the file yet.
	
	* src/m_ppath.cc: Created this file. No functions in the file yet.


2002-05-08  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-66

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Fixed typo that lead to LaTeX fail.

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data): Small change in comment block.

2002-05-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-65

	* src/workspace.cc: Started to sort the variables in alphebetical 
	order. See note in the file. Placed all old functions below a line 
	with the idea to revise the functions before they are moved back.

	Introduced and wrote about: 
	  - atmosphere_dim
	  - a_los
	  - a_pos
	  - blackbody_ground
	  - cloudbox_on
	  - cloudbox_limits
	  - e_ground
	  - lat_grid
	  - lon_grid
	  - p_grid
	  - ppath
	  - ppath_partial
	  - ppath_step
	  - r_geoid
	  - t_field
	  - t_ground
	  - z_field
	  - z_ground

	Removed a lot of old WSV.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Started to sort the methods in alphebetical order.
	See note in the file. Placed all old functions below a line with the
	idea to revise the functions before they are moved back.

	Removed WSF hseXxxx, refrXxx

2002-05-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-64

	* src/interpolation.cc: Finished all blue interpolation functions
	(interpweights and interp functions).

	* src/interpolation.h: Added headers for the new functions.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc: Some testing for the blue
	interpolation functions. They are fast! Turning assertions off
	gives a significant further speed increase, so the default for
	"real" calculations should be -O2 optimization and disabled
	assertions. (The speed impact of assertions is mainly due to the
	assertions inside the index operators, which are called a lot if
	tensor dimensions are looped.)

	* absorption.cc,
	atm_funcs.cc,
	continua.cc,
	file.cc,
	lineshapes.cc,
	m_abs.cc,
	m_hdf.cc,
	math_funcs.cc,
	matpackI.h,
	matpackIII.h,
	matpackIV.h,
	matpackV.h,
	matpackVI.h,
	matpackVII.h,
	ppath.cc: Changed "\retval x" to "\param x Output:". The use of
	retval for output parameters was a misunderstanding on my side and
	lead to spurious doxygen warning messages. Output parameters
	should be documented like this:
	\param A Output: Describe A here.

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Updated instructions for Doxygen
	headers. 

2002-05-06  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-63

	* src/interpolation.cc: Finished gridpos. Implemented 1D
	interpweights and 2D blue interpweights. If fd and 1-fd are stored
	in an array, one can use nested for loops to compute the
	weights. Great! 

	* src/test_matpack.cc (test32): Test case for mult.

	* src/matpackI.h: Made documentation of mult functions more clear:
	The input and output matrix must not be the same!

	* src/logic.cc: Made Index input arguments const Index&.

2002-05-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-62

	* src/species_data.cc: Included  JPL tags for HOBr.

2002-05-06  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-61
		
	* src/lin_alg.cc/h: Modified interfaces for LU- functions and
        added routine for the matrix exponential function.

	* src/test_linalg.cc: Test adapted to the new functions.

2002-05-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-60
	
	* src/lin_alg.cc: Include math.h for gcc>=2.96.

	* src/test_tensor.cc: Include math.h for gcc>=2.96.

2002-05-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-59

	* src/workspace.cc: Started to introduce new workspace variables.

	* src/los.cc/h: Removed these files. Made corresponding changes
	throughout the files, e.g:

	* src/Makefile.am: Removed los.cc and los.h. 

	* src/groups.cc: Removed Los, added Ppath and Tensor3.

2002-05-03  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-58

	* src/logic.cc: Added Matrix version of is_size.

	* src/logic.h: Added header for Matrix version of is_size.

	* doc/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Removed emacs directory.

2002-05-03  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-57

	* src/logic.cc: New file. Contains all logical functions, i.e.,
	function called is_something that return bool. 
	These functions are intended to be used either inside "if"
	statements or inside "assert" statements.
	The condition should have a simple and intuitive meaning!

	* src/logic.h: New file, headers for logic.cc.

	* src/check_input.cc: Now includes logic.h.

	* src/ppath.cc: Now includes logic.h.

	* src/math_funcs.h: Removed is_something function headers.

	* src/math_funcs.cc: Moved is_something functions to logic.cc.

	* src/interpolation.cc: New file: Interpolation routines. 
	(grid_pos): I just started with this, it is not yet complete. Will
	probably continue tomorrow.

	* src/interpolation.h: New file: Header file for interpolation.cc.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc: Test program for interpolation
	functions. 

	* src/Makefile.am: Added test_interpolation.

	* doc/index.html.in: Removed the paragraph about the old Emacs
	doxygen macros, since they are no longer there.

	* configure.in: Removed output target doc/emacs/Makefile.

2002-05-02  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-56

	* src/lin_alg.cc/h: Created this file for the linear algebra
	functions we need for the radiative transfer
	calculations. Implemented functions to solve linear equation
	systems using the LU decomposition method.

	* src/test_linalg.cc: test the functions in lin_alg.cc

2002-04-25  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-55

	* doc/uguide/development.tex: Updated this file. Some small
	changes. Most significant are the new recommendations for
	documentation headers.

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Put development.tex back in.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added template for
	documentation strings.

	* doc/emacs/: Removed everything in this directory. There is now a
	better Doxygen package for Emacs:
	Doxymacs (http://doxymacs.sourceforge.net/). 

	* doc/examples/fantasy2.arts: Added this file, which contains more
	thinking about agendas.

2002-04-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-54

	* src/m_los.cc,m_wfs.cc,m_batch.cc: Removed these files as everything
	will be rewritten anyhow. I think it is a good idea to remove as much 
	as possible. It is no big danger to remove things as they still exist
	in arts-1 and can be copied back. So, PLEASE DO SOME CLEANING.
	
	* src/atm_funcs.cc: Removed obselete functions.

	* src/ppath.cc: Works now for 1D and no refraction. As soon as it is
	clear how refraction will be calculated (there should be an agenda
	as for absorption), it should be a rather quick thing to put in 1D
	with refraction.

2002-04-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-53

	* src/check_input.cc/h: Started this file. The intention of this file
	is to hold functions that help us to check the input to functions.
	By doing general functions, more careful checks can be done and better
	error messages can be given. If you have to type everything for each
	function, you tend to become sloppy. There are two series of functions:
	assert_xxx and chk_xx. Have a look in the file and you will understand.

	SO USE THESE FUNCTIONS, and ADD NEW ONES WHEN NEEDED.

	* src/math_funcs.cc: Started to revise this file. The existing 
	functions are moved down and my idea is that when we found that a 
	function really is needed, it can be moved up, and then be polished.
	I think there is some old junk in the file.

	* src/ppath.cc: Added this file. The file will include functions to
	determine propagation paths. Started to move things from los.cc
	(ppath.cc replaces los.cc). Changes are needed as the definition of
	the Ppath structure is changed. Quite some work, but nothing works
	yet.

	* src/ppath.h: Added this file to hold the declaration of the Ppath 
	structure and functions in ppath.cc.
	
2002-04-14  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-52

	* doc/examples/fantasy.arts: Added this file to play around
	in. I'm not happy with the absorption part. Everything is so
	complicated and not user-friendly. But how to make it both modular
	and user friendly?

2002-04-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-51

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Finished text for general 1D and 2D geometrical
	expressions. 

2002-04-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-50

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Started some writing but not got time to finish
	it. I will continue at home.

2002-04-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-49

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Added the commands \artsstyle, \textindex,
	\wsfindex, \wsvindex, \fileindex, \funcindex and \structindex.
	The command replaces the old \qindex. 

	ARTS workspace methods, variables etc. are no longer written using the
	\verb environment. Use now the \artsstyle command. This command will
	write the text with style \texttt. I made the change as verbatim
	cannot be used inside commands, figure text etc., which has been a 
	problem for me several times. The drawback of using \texttt is that
	underscores must be proceeded with a backslash (e.g. \_).

	The other commands, ending with "index", writes the text and makes
	on the same time a index mark. The commands beside \textindex are 
	releated to ARTS and writes the text by using \artsstyle and puts
	the reference as a subentry to an appropiate text string. For example,
	\wsvindex is the command to use when defining a ARTS workspace 
	variable. See the index page for the result.

	I hope that these indexes will help us to link AUG and ARTS better.
	The old AUG did very few direct references to ARTS. I am trying now
	to improve this by stating which function that does a special
	calculation etc. This can work the other way around, when writing the
	header of a function it should now be easier to make a reference to
	AUG if the function is indexed in AUG. Before you did not know in
	what section a description ended up (the section could be moved 
	around). We can now refer to the index page to find where a function
	is discussed.

	* doc/uguide: Included the new commands in the files that are presently
	included. You have to adapt the other files when they are included.

2002-04-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-48

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Description of the propagation path structure,
	Ppath. Started on general geometric expressions for calculating the
	path.

2002-04-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-47

	* configure.in: Added doc/uguide/Figs/ppath/Makefile.am

2002-04-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-46

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Completed the part about geodetic issues.

2002-04-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-45

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Some text about geoid ellipsoids etc. Made some
	figures.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/ppath: Added this folder and some figure files.

2002-04-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-44

	* doc/uguide/Makefile.am: Added makeindex commands.

2002-04-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-43

	* aii/Makefile.am, ami/arts/Makefile.am, ami/file/Makefile.am,
        ami/general/Makefile.am, ami/hmatrix/Makefile.am,
	ami/math/Makefile.am, ami/path/Makefile.am, ami/physics/Makefile.am,
        ami/plot/Makefile.am, ami/retrieval/Makefile.am,
	doc/uguide/Figs/Makefile.am: Use wildcards for EXTRA_DIST so we
	don't have to add each new file to Makefile.am.

2002-04-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-42

	* Please read, comment and/or correct what I have written in
	Chapter 2 of AUG.

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: Included the epic and eepic packages for drawing
	figures inside LaTex. Are these the best packages for this? These seem
	at least to be standard packages. But do you have any better sugestion?

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: New figure for LOS angles and
	some new text. Corrected and polished existing text slightly. I am
	now ready with what I will write in this chapter this time. So,
	please read it.  I am sure that there are many language
	errors. Please fix what you find.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Added section headings and made a figure for
	geocentric and geodetic latitudes.

2002-03-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-41

	* AUG: Note that figures now shall be placed in sub-folders to
	Figs/ (as suggested by Stefan).  When the revision of AUG is
	ready, all figures in Figs/ will be removed. This has been done
	for fm_definitions (see below).
	
	* doc/uguide: Added style files for the algorithm and algorithmic
	packages. See fm_definitions for example on how to use these
	packages. I have a manaul (ps-file) that I can send you if you are
	interested.
	
	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: More writing. Mainly on the clear sky
	RTE part. Added two figures. Added an algorith over the RTE part.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/fm_definitions: Created this folder and moved
	the figures (and associated Matlab scripts) to this folder.
	
	* doc/uguide/Figs/fm_definitions/mkfigs_ppath_cases.m: Created this
	function to illustrate propagation paths.

2002-03-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-40

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Writing on the sensor section and
	started on the clear sky RTE section. 

2002-03-26  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-39

	* src/test_tensor.cc (test8): Added a cute little test that checks
	all 128 const index functions.
	(test9): And another cute tests that checks the non-const index
	functions. 
	Result: Everything seems to work fine!

2002-03-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-38

	* When including the bug fixes from arts1 for temperature WFs, I missed
	a change in methods.cc so the program did not compile. Sorry, for that.
	
	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Fixed some problems in the existing
	text. Did dome more writing on the compulsory sensor variables and
	changed text to follow the definition of the cloud box.
	Stefan, there are some comments for you inside the file at the end.

	* doc/uguide/Figs/mkfigs_atm_dims.m: The figures are now converted to
	PDF with epstopdf. Adapted to new cloud box definition.

2002-03-22  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-37

	* src/matpackVII.h: First implementation of Tensor7 finished. This
	seems to push my present concept to the limit, since I had to
	manually edit the 128 different index functions. Higher order
	tensors are only feasible with some kind of automatic code
	generation system. 

        * src/matpackI.h, src/matpackIII.h, src/matpackIV.h,
	src/matpackV.h, src/matpackVI.h: Adjusted for Tensor7. (Mainly
	added friend declarations.)

	* src/test_tensor.cc: Added simple test for Tensor7. There should
	be some more thorough and systematic testing...

2002-03-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-36

	* Included changes made for arts1:

	* src/m_wfs.cc (k_temp_nohydro): Code changed according to the bug
	in the equation discussed below. Temperature WFs without HSE seems now
	to be OK. Checks have ben performed with text_Kt.m.

	To summerize, all temperature WFs have been looked at and everything
	seem to be OK. There were bugs for all three versions before. Sorry
	for that.

	* doc/uguide/wfuns_atm.tex: A mistake in the equation giving the
	temperature derivative of the Planck function found.

2002-03-20  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-35

	* src/matpackVI.h: Added. Implementation of Tensor6. A first
	version of this is complete. 

	* src/matpackVII.h: Added. Implementation of Tensor7. This is
	still under construction.

	* src/Makefile.am: Added matpackVI and VII to test_tensor sources.

	* src/test_tensor.cc: Added some tests for Tensor6.

	* doc/uguide/references.bib: Added Mishchenko book.

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Started to write on the clear sky
	RT section.

2002-03-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-34

	* src/matpackI.h: Changed order of parameters for poly_root_solve.

2002-03-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-33

	* src/poly_roots.{h,cc}: Changed order of parameter.

2002-03-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-32

	* src/poly_roots.{h,cc}: Changed interface of poly_root_solve to make
	it arts-compliant. The solution matrix is passed by reference to the
	function and must have the correct size.

	* src/poly_roots.cc: Use the pointer to coeffs.mdata and roots.mdate
	instead of copying all elements (if Numeric is not double we still
	have to copy them).

	* src/matpack1.h: Made poly_root_solve a friend function of
	ConstVectorView and ConstMatrixView to access mdata.

2002-03-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-31

	* reconf: Removed --enable-more-warnings. This is now part of
	configure.in.

	* configure.in: Enable warnings in maintainer mode by default. Could
	still be turned off with ./reconf --disable-more-warnings.

2002-03-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-30

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Fixed and changed according to
	comments and discission input from Stefan.

	The main thing is that we decided that the most basic variable is
	put in as the outermost index in matrices and tensors. That is,
	reversed order compared to before.

2002-03-18  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-29

	* doc/examples/*.arts.in: The outermost method must now simply be
	called Main. To use DefineAgenda was unlogical, since defining an
	agenda and executing an agenda are quite different things.

	* src/parser.cc: Adapted to new controlfile structure. Cleaned up
	output to out3.

	* src/array.h: Changed output operator for ConstVectorView to
	put all elements in one row.

	* src/matpackI.h: Changed output operator for ConstVectorView to
	put all elements in one row.

	* reconf: Added --enable-more-warnings switch to configure call. 

2002-03-18  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-28

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Fixed some typos. Added some
	comments, marked by SAB.

	* doc/uguide/.cvsignore: Added uguide_pdf.idx.

2002-03-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-27

	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: More text written. Started on sensor 
	description.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Added this file to hold description of
	propagation paths.

2002-03-15  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-26

	* configure.in: Added a switch to enable-more-warnings that turns
	off the checking of unused parameters. This, because dummy
	parameters are used as a trick to select functions, for example
	the joker in the matpack functions. Also the getaway functions for
	the engine have sometimes unused parameters. We don't want to
	issue a warning for that.

	* src/matpackV.h: Bug fix: Added missing return statements for
	const index functions. I discoverd this bug because of the enabled
	warnings, so warnings are clearly useful!

	* src/m_agenda.cc: Added this file, containing workspace methods
	for Agenda.

	* src/: Modified the parser and the overall control structure to
	accept agendas.

	* doc/examples: Removed old example files starting with auto_.
	Adapted all examples to work with the new controlfile
	syntax. (Added a surrounding AgendaDefine(main_agenda).)

2002-03-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-25

	* doc/uguide/main.tex: I have introduced index into AUG. The idea
	is not to make a complete index register, that is to ambitious.  I
	think it is sufficient, and a good help for the readers, just to
	make a reference to the page where a term is defined or
	introduced.  Is this a good idea? I have put in some test indexes
	in fm_definitions.  Note the macro \qindex, defined in main.tex,
	that makes it easier to put in an index. I don't think we shall
	have index of several levels, if the term consists of several words
	(normally not more than 2), refer to the words as one unit to make
	things simple.

	If anybody knows how to change the title for the index page from
	"Index" to "Definition of terms", please go ahead.

	To update the index list, you have to run "makeindex uguide"
	
	* doc/uguide/fm_definitions.tex: Started to write in this chapter.
	Please read the introduction part (present Chapter 1-2) and give
	comments, both on layout and content.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs: Moved symbol macros to this file. An idea
	with this is that it should be possible to use this macro file for
	other documents. The old macro names are changed and changes will
	be needed when re-introducing the chapters. Sorry for this, but as
	the old macro names were just a mess, I made this change. If it is a
	comfort, I will be the one that will have to most of the changes.
	I have tried to come up with a consistent naming scheme so it should
	be possible to remember, or figure out, the name of the macros.
	Note especially the aXxx macros which are handy and would help us
	to have a uniform style without making a macro for each subscript
	to a variable.

	* General: Started to work on agendas (what we used to call method
	lists).

	* src/agenda.h: Added.
	An agenda is a list of workspace methods (including keyword data) to
  	be executed. There are workspace variables of class agenda that can
  	contain a list of methods to execute for a particular purpose, for
  	example to compute the lineshape in an absorption calculation. The
  	controlfile contains a list of agenda definitions, including the
  	agenda `main', which is then executed. Overall, this concept is in
  	analogy to a C program that consists of various functions and one
  	function main.

	* src/agenda.cc: Added. Contains functions for Agenda.

	* src/main.cc: Removed executor and give_up. Instead, there is now
	a member function execute of Agenda.

	* src/make_auto_wsv_h.cc: Made the occupation list (which WSVs are
	occupied) a part of the WorkSpace. Added member functions to check
	and modify occupation.

	* src/wsv_aux.cc: Added. Contains implementation of member
	functions of WorkSpace.

	* src/parser.h: Adapted to use of Agenda. 

	* src/parser.cc: Adapted to use of Agenda. 
	
	* src/Makefile.am: Added the new files.

	* doc/doxygen/Makefile.am: Added generation of tags for
	doxymacs. The tags are stored in file arts.tag.

2002-03-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-22

	* doc/uguide: Restart of the user guide for the new version.
	First of all, I have commented out most of the chapters (done in 
	main.tex). The idea is to enforce that the user guide only contains 
	stuff that is consistent with the new version. So before a chapter is 
	re-introduced, all its content shall be checked and the text shall be 
	changed where needed. Please, remember to also check the figure folder
	and to remove figures not used any longer. 

	Two new introduction chapters added. See notes in introduction.tex.
	Some text written and two figures included.

	* src/los.cc: 1D interpolation of an absorption Tensor3
	fixed. Note that is a temporary solution until we have more general
	ways to obtain the absorption at an arbitrary point.
	
	* src/los.cc: Wrote an outline describing my present ideas about how
	to fix the interpolations.
	
2002-02-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-6

	* src/los.cc: Started to work on interpolation and assert functions. 
	We should make set of functions for making asserts and size checks 
	simpler (as started by the check_xx functions ion arts1).

2002-02-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-1-5

	test_tensor.

	* src/test_tensor.cc: Test program for matpackIV. Copied from
	test_matpack.cc.

2002-02-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-4

	* SOME INFORMATION: I will not give any deatils here about my work
	to save time. The plan is to finish LOS/RTE calculations for 1D
	and 2D without refraction (i.e. including interpolation of
	absorption etc. and evaluation of the radiative transfer equation
	along the LOS) and then describe the approach taken in AUG.

	However, I should mention that I want to replace existing math
	functions and to remove the ones not used. For this reason, I put
	new math functions (or copies of existing ones, renamed by adding
	the number 2) in los.cc. This includes a new set of interpolation
	routines taking index positions as input. For example, the index
	position 6.5 means that a position is exactly between the points
	with index 6 and 7, index position 5 is exactly at the point with
	index 5 etc. As these index positions easily can be calculated
	when determining the LOS, this should save a lot of time for the
	interpolation. In addition, as the LOS points now mainly are placed
	at grid boundaries, for most points an interpolation is not needed and
	the index positions can be used to avoid unnecessary interpolation.
	
	* src/los.cc: Finished the LOS calculations for 1D and no refraction.
	As usual it is downwards observations from inside the atmosphere that
	makes everything complicated. 

2002-02-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-1-3

	* src/los.cc: Added this file for starting on the new implementation
	of the LOS calculations. Started on a function for 1D and no 
	refraction.

	related tables now in. Resolving the referencies and warnings.
	
2002-01-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-0-0-pre4

	* uguide: Removed a reference to the sensor WFs section that is 
	commented out. There is almost nothing in this section and the little
	content is not in sync with ARTS, so no idea to include it.

2002-01-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-0-0-pre3

	* ami: Improved the README file slightly (I had forgotten that there 
	was one). Updated the Makefile.am files. Removed rand_test, that 
	existed in two folders.

2002-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts-1-0-0-pre2

	* Sorry Oliver, but I have stuff that must be commited now.

	* ami/arts/tag2mo.m: The function now works for tag string with more
	than one part, e.g. "H2O-PWR98,H2O". 

	* ami/file/read_linefile.m: The reading can now be limited to a 
	frequency range.

	* ami/file/combine_lines.m: Created this function to lower the number
	of transitions in the linefile when several transitions are basically
	identical, which is the case for some species, such as HNO3. The
	intensities of such transitions are added to create a pseudo-line that
	gives the same contribution as the individual transitions.
	
2002-01-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* arts-1-0-0-pre1

	* Just tagged the current version as pre1. From now on only bug
	fixes for the 1.0 release should be checked in. All new stuff
	should go into arts2 which should be started at the end of this
	week. If you have to make any checkins the next version number
	should be arts-1-0-0-pre2.
