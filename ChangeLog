2017-10-05 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-820

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid2):
	Initialize jacobian containers properly. Makes plenty of the former
	issues go away. Removed the IsEmpty checks accordingly.

	* src/rte.[cc,h] (get_stepwise_scattersky_propmat,
	get_stepwise_scattersky_source):
	Use FOR_ANALYTICAL_JACOBIANS_DO instead of blindly looping over jacobian

2017-10-05 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-818
	
	* src/m_fos.cc:  Change trying to debug error reported by Jana 
	(I cannot reproduce the error, but these changes should make it 
	more robust)

2017-10-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-817

	* src/microphysics.cc (psd_rain_W16): Bug fix. The factor 100 was
	applied on lambda too early, and then gave an incorrect N0.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat): Retrieval of e.g. both
	rain and ice diod not work as scattering properties were extracted
	quite blindly and temperature interpolation problems occured.
	Scattering properties now only extracted were actually needed.

	* src/m_oem.cc (xaStandard): Corrected error string associated
	with particle_bulkprop_field.

2017-10-04 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-816

	* src/m_fox.cc:  Should now work with sensor jacobians

	* src/jacobian.cc:  Updated some comments

2017-10-03  Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* src/methods.cc (x2artsStandard, xaStandard):
	- Added wind fields to arguments

	* src/special_interp.cc(regrid_atmfield_by_gp):
	- Fixed if statement for 3D atmosphere

2017-10-03 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-814

	* src/rt4.cc (sca_optpropCalc):
	Revision for more consistent handling of scattering matrix (from single
	T-gridpoint) with extinction and absorption data (from T-interpolation).
	Preservation of bulk-Z norm needs to be checked vs. gridpoint-T
	ext/abs	(regards the structure of the phase function), but output
	bulk-Z for RT4 solution needs to be normalized to bulk-scatt coeff
	consistent with ext/abs extracted for use in RT4 solution (regards the
	scattering coefficient).

	ATTENTION:
	This needs to be taken care of also when implementing T-grid reduction
	for scat_data. Seems to be a bad idea to allow K and a on different
	T-grids than Z (or we need to use unity-normalized Z. or keep track
	of which T is used for Z when reduced to single T-point).

	* src/m_fos.cc(iyHybrid2),
	src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat):
	Pass scat_species for getting scat jacobian pointers.
	Safety check for jacobian_quantities and dpnd_field_dx consistency
	(dpnd_field_dx needs filled array elements for scat jacobian, empty
	elements for non-scat jacobians).

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Made scat_data check non-scat_species safe.

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc, interpolate_scat_angle):
	Minor stuff.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:
	Initialize dpnd_field_dx.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/hybridscat/TestHybrid.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts:
	Remove now redundant dpnd_field_dx initialization.

2017-10-03  Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-813

	* src/m_oem.cc (x2artsStandard)
	- Removed trailing whitespaces

	* src/m_retrieval.cc (retrievalDefClose)
	- Removed size check between covmat_se and sensor_response.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/oem/TestOEM.arts
	- Fixed order of retrieval definition and cloudbox_checkedCalc

2017-10-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-812

	BREAKS CONTROLFILES using iy_surface/surface_rtprop__sub_agenda.

	* The system for surface types is now changed to make use of the
	ArrayOfAgenda mechanism.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_rtpropCallAgendaX)
	(iySurfaceCallAgendaX): New methods, replace the sub_agenda methods.

	* src/workspace.cc:
	* src/agendas.cc: iy_surface_sub_agenda0-5 and
	surface_rtprop_sub_agenda_0-5 replaced with
	iy_surface_agenda_array and surface_rtprop_agenda_array,
	respectively.

2017-09-29 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-811

	BREAKS CONTROLFILES.

	* src/m_fos.cc(iyHybrid2),
	src/rte.[cc,h] (get_stepwise_scattersky_propmat, get_stepwise_scattersky_source):
	Moved cloudy-level-check outside the scattersky methods, ie only call
	them for cloudy levels. This also circumvents previous issues with
	un-updated cloud contributions. Add explicit check for dpnd_field_dx
	consistency with jacobian_quantities.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc(cloudboxOff, pnd_fieldCalcFrompnd_field_raw,
	pnd_fieldZero, pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields):
	Output dpnd_field_dx, sized consistently with jacobian_quantities.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Don't check particle_bulkprop_field. But do check dpnd_field_dx, for
	consistency with jacobian_quantities (ie we now need to make the
	jacobian definitions before this).

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted for changes above.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (JacobianDoit):
	Adapted for changes above.

	(jacobianDoitAddSpecies):
	Do not require cloudbox_checked anymore.

	* src/m_microphysics.cc (pnd_fieldCalcFromParticleBulkProps):
	Check particle_bulkprop_field and particle_bulkprop_names here (instead
	of in cloudbox_checkedCalc). Generalized zero-outside-of-cloudbox check
	of particle_bulkprop_field.

	* src/rt4.cc (sca_optpropCalc):
	Bugfix in handling 1freq-reduced scat_data.

	* CHANGES-2.3: Document jacobians-before-cloudbox requirement.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Added TestWfunsHybClear to test suite.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfunsHybClear.arts:
	Switched on all analytical abs species and wind cases incl Compares to
	TestWfuns results.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:
	Separated instrument jacobians from wind jacobians for better
	comparability with TestWfunsHybClear (that can't handle instrument yet).

	* arts-2-3-810
	
	clearsky jacobians are now working for iyhybrid2 (so long as the input
	system is correct, which remains to be tested for things other than
	rel VMR).  There is still some friction between definitions in clearsky
	and scattersky variables that needs working out (size mismatches)
	
	* src/jacobian.cc:  Simplified expressions.  Also, has to add to diy2
	not diy1...  this explains the factor 2 error!
	
	* src/rte.cc:  (get_stepwise_effective_source) simplified expressions.
	(get_stepwise_scattersky_propmat) fixed setting derivaitves to zero 
	in non-cloudy cases.  (get_stepwise_scattersky_source) fixed setting
	to zero in non-cloudy cases. 

2017-09-28 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-809
	
	* src/m_fos.cc:  Needed call to (adapt_stepwise_partial_derivatives)
	Also updated so that there is a check for stokes_dim since the linalg
	function "id_mat" does not work for 1-by-1 matrices (sometimes; why?)
	
	* src/rte.cc: Updated (get_stepwise_transmission_matrix) to check 
	stokes_dim since id_mat did not work for 1-by-1 matrices (again; why?)

2017-09-27  Manfred Brath  <manfred.brath@uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-808

	* src/m_microphysics.cc  
	- (psdMY2, dNdD_MY2, dNdD_MY2_M,psdS2M, dNdD_SM2, dNdD_SM2_M):
	Renamed to psdMY05, dNdD_MY05, dNdD_MY05_M,psdSB06, dNdD_SB06, dNdD_SB06_M, 	
	and adjusted the function when needed to handle the new names including

	pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields):
	Updated built-in doc according to the new names.
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields):

	- Added function to enforce constraints on VMR quantities
	- Enforce constraints in x2artsStandard
	- Fixed application of transformation in x2artsStandard
	- Removed jacobian_indices arguments from OEM WSMs since only the transformed
	  indices are needed

	* src/m_retrieval:
	- Enabled adding of retrieval quantities without corresponding covariance
	  block to *covmat_sx*
	- Renamed covmatSetDiagonal to covmatDiagonal
	- Added covmat_sxAddBlock WSM
	- Adapted retrievalDefClose to take into account transformations

	Some info print output. Some more xml output as ref for Hyb test case.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:
	More subcases switched on (remaining switched-off-ones not
	working (yet?)). Use TestWfuns y & jacobian output as reference (output
	not commited, though. Ie run TestWfuns first to create that).

2017-09-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-805
	
	* Added TESSEM2 implementation.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/tessem/TestTessem.arts,
	controlfiles/testdata/tessem_sav_net_H.txt,
	controlfiles/testdata/tessem_sav_net_V.txt:

	Added TESSEM test case and neural net parameter data.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt, src/tessem.{cc,h}:

	C++ port of the original TESSEM2 Fortran code.

	* src/m_tessem.cc, src/methods.cc:

	Added workspace methods TessemNNReadAscii and TestTessem.

	TestTessem should be adapted to serve then as the main interface
	function to the model.

	* src/m_general.{cc,h}: Add Print for TessemNN.

2017-09-21 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-804
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}:  Changed to level-based system.  Dunno why 
	I forgot this is the ARTS way in the original implementation.
	Still missing HSE derivative since HSE is not based on physics
	under consideration in any iy-calculator
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Added some comments for the stepwise functions.
	Added some extra checks for get_stepwise_effective_source.
	
	* src/m_fos.cc:  Changed iyHybrid2 to use different checks,
	use the level definition of jacobian, and to convert path-values
	to Rodger's values.  (Discussion point for future: why can't we
	let the iy-calculators do the physics and let the y-calculators
	worry about converting to Rodger's nomenclature?  It would 
	make life easier to not mix the two together. Twice in the same 
	commit realizing that this mixing makes life difficult has me 
	wondering...)
	
	* src/propagationmatrix.h:  Added an IsEmpty() return of bool.
	Returns true if there are no frequencies defined.  Would also
	want an IsZero() test, but could not get the <algorithm> library
	working on our vectors.

2017-09-20 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-803

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid2):

	Added new WSM to set a freq-dependent, but otherwise constant doit_i_field.

	(doit_i_field_monoSetConst):
	Bugfixes & cleanup.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfunsHybClear.arts:
	Added. (Quasi-)clearsky test case for Jacobians from iyHybrid*. Setup
	equivalent to TestWfuns.arts.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:
	Some (outcommented) write statements to help comparison with WfunsHybrid
	case.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f:
	Increased max number of layers in order to allow it to run on wfun test
	case atm setup. Revert in case this degrades performance noticeably.

2017-09-20 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	Reverted changes to jacobianAddAbsSpecies that caused tests to fail.

	* arts-2-3-802

	  This is a much better solution anyways.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.{cc,h}:
	- Reverted changes in call to jacobianAddAbsSpecies

	* src/m_retrieval.cc:
	- Reverted changes in call to jacobianAddAbsSpecies and jacobianAddTemperature

	- Added arguments to add affine transformations to absorption species and
	temperatures.
	- Added workspace method to apply transformations to jacobian, which is automatically
	add to jacobian_agenda if any RQ has a transformation.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.{cc,h}: Adapted call to jacobianAddAbsSpecies

	* src/m_oem.cc:
	- Modified x2artsStandard to include transformation
	- Modified xaStandard to include inverse transformation

	* src/m_retrieval.cc:
	- Adapted calls to jacobianAddAbsSpecies and jacobianAddTemperature

	- Adapted md_data entries for jacobianAddAbsSpecies, jacobianAddTemperatures,
	retrievalAddAbsSpecies

2017-09-20 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-800
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}:  Added solution for new formulation of RTE in
	iyHybrid2.  Still need HSE since this is treated on pseudo-expressions
	rather than actual dependencies in old path.  Needs better integration
	into RTE.
	
	* src/m_fos.{cc,h}:  Added temporary solution to Jacobian calculations.
	Still need a test for this...

	* ChangeLog: Missed save from prev commit.

2017-09-19 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-798

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid2),
	src/rte.[cc,h] (get_stepwise_scattersky_source):
	Revised scattering source calculation and added derivatives for it.

2017-09-19 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-797

	* src/m_fos.cc, src/methods.cc (iyHybrid2),
	src/rte.[cc,h] (get_stepwise_scattersky_propmat):
	Revised scatt-sky optical property extraction and added derivatives to
	this. Removed ppath(d)pnd(_dx) calc from get_stepwise_scattersky_propmat,
	instead do this outside the level-loop at once using the dedicated
	function get_ppath_cloudvars.

	* src/m_fos.cc, src/methods.cc(iyHybrid):
	Make dpnd_field_dx and input.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc, src/m_fos.cc, src/m_transmitter.cc, src/m_rte.cc,
	src/rte.[cc,h]:
	Renamed clear2cloudbox to clear2cloudy as it is not only checking/
	flagging whether in cloudbox, but even whether any non-zero pnd exist at
	the level in question.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/hybridscat/TestHybrid.arts:
	Adapt for now required Jacobian input.

	* CHANGES-2.3:
	Update with (some of) the recent changes.

2017-09-18 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-796

	ATTENTION: Breaks backward compatability of cloudy-sky controlfiles.

	Moved "old type" scat_data to scat_data_raw. Sorted out WSM that
	(primarily, hence per default) act on each of the scat_data*.

	Break get_ppath_partopt into a part deriving atmospheric
	particle-related path variables (get_ppath_cloudvars) and one deriving
	particle optical properties along path (get_ppath_partopt).

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyAddParticles):
	Ported to exclusively use new type scat_data. Removed frequency
	perturbation feature (considering that typical freq perturbs on
	particle props has negligible effects only).

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Renamed GIN parameters scat_data_fcheck and scat_data_check_type to
	more descriptive scat_data_type and scat_data_check_level, respectively.

2017-09-17 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-795

	* src/arts_api.[h/cc](add_variable):
	Added name argument so that names of newly created variables can be also used
	by the ARTS runtime.

	* src/interactive_workspace.[h/cc](add_variable):
	Added name argument so that names of newly created variables can be also used
	by the ARTS runtime.

2017-09-15  Manfred Brath  <manfred.brath@uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-794

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):  Changed the check for 
	particle_bulkprop_field. If the lower cloudbox limit is set to the lowest
	atmospheric level, then the check will not give an error if the
	particle_bulkprop_field has non-zero value at the lower cloudbox boundary.	
	
	* src/math_funcs.cc (mod_gamma_dist): Changed the error message
	
	* src/methods.cc (psdS2M, psdMY2): Written built-in doc
	
	* src/m_microphysics.cc: 

	(psdS2M, psdMY2):
	Added new two moment scheme distributions. Particle size distribution values
	are tested. The new scheme will give except for the differences due to 
	rescalling the same pndfields as pnd_fieldS2M/MY2. The partial derivatives
	need further testing,  but so far they seem to be working. 
	
	(dNdD_SM2, dNdD_SM2_M, dNdD_MY2, dNdD_MY2_M) 
	Changed to handle the new calls of psd_S2M, psd_MY2.
	
	(pnd_fieldCalcFromParticleBulkProps):
	Changed the check for particle_bulkprop_field. If the lower cloudbox limit 
	is set to the lowest atmospheric level, then the check will not give an 
	error if the particle_bulkprop_field has non-zero value at the lower 
	cloudbox boundary.
	
	* src/microphysics.{h,cc} (psd_MY2, psd_S2M):
	Changed to handle a grid of sizes at once and changed the tags defining the
	hydrometeor) scheme.
	
	* src/microphysics.cc (pnd_fieldS2M, pnd_fieldMY2): Changed to handle the 
	new calls of psd_S2M, psd_MY2.

2017-09-15 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-793

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc):
	Fixed order of parameters atmgeom_checked and atmfields_check to be the same
	as in methods.cc.

2017-09-14 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-792

	* src/methods.cc (PFromZSimple):
	Added md_data entry for PFromZSimple.

2017-09-11 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simon.pfreundschuh@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-791

	* src/m_retrieval.cc (ZFromPSimple):
	Moved pressure check out of loop to avoid inconsistent state in case
	of error.

	* src/m_retrieval.cc (PFromZSimple):
	Ported PFromZSimple method from atmlab.

2017-09-05 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-790

	* src/methods.cc (iyHybrid2):
	Fixed interface definition.

2017-09-05 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-789

	More work toward using pre-interpolated scat_data throughout.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:
	Inititalize scat_data_checked. Will go away again once all solvers are
	converted.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatSpeciesInit):
	Inititalize/reset scat_data_checked.

	* src/rte.[cc,h]:
	(throughout):
	Sorted out references to get_ppath_ext (either get_ppath_partopt or
	get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat).
	
	(get_ppath_ext):
	Renamed to get_ppath_partopt (as it does NOT provide "clearsky"
	ppath_ext but particle abs and ext). Use scat_data_checked to decide
	which type scat_data is at hand.

	(get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat):
	Adapted to get_ppath_ext/get_ppath_partopt renaming and interface change.

	(get_ppath_scat_source, get_ppath_scat_source_fixT):
	Adapted to exclusively use pre-interpolated scat_data.

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid):
	Revised for use of pre-interpolated scat_data. Removed
	use_mean_scat_data option.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_data_monoExtract):
	Added, probably tentative. Extracts scat_data_mono from pre-interpolated
	scat_data (instead of performing an interpolation as scat_data_monoCalc
	does).

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat), src/m_fos.cc (iyFOS, fos),
	src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink, iyTransmissionStandard):
	Use scat_data_checked. At the moment needed as input to
	get_ppath_partopt and get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat to distinguish whether we
	it's pre-interpolated scat_data or not that are at hand (for those WSMs
	they are typically not yet).

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard):
	Dummy scat_data_checked in get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat call.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Adapted to WSM additions/interface changes above.

2017-09-03 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-788

	* src/m_microphysics.cc (psdMH97,psdF07,psdW16):
	Partly revert of arts-2-3-787 - move check of s/i/rwc back to beginning
	of level-loop, before the t-range check. this as we loop over full
	cloudbox here, and of course the cloudbox can contain levels with t that
	are outside the valid t-range of a hydrometeor. as long as the wc for
	this hydrometeor is 0, that's perfectly fine.

2017-09-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-787

	* Temperature changed from being treated as a formal pnd/psd input
	variable, to be an auxiliary variable that is always at hand. This
	means that "Temperature" no longer shall be included in
	pnd_agenda_input_names. So e.g.:

	ArrayOfStringSet( pnd_agenda_input_names, [ "IWC", "Temperature" ] )

	shall be changed to

	ArrayOfStringSet( pnd_agenda_input_names, [ "IWC"] )

	* src/m_microphysics.cc (psdMH97,psdF07): Temperature now taken
	from pnd_agenda_input_t.

	(psdW16): As above and also added t_min, t_max and picky.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Removed jacobian as input
	to inversion_iterate_agenda. Not needed after Simon's improvement
	of x2artsStandard. And added pnd_agenda_input_t as input to
	pnd_agenda_array.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Introduced pnd_agenda_input_t.

2017-09-01 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-786
	
	* src/m_fos.cc:  Added a iyHybrid2 that is splitting up the call
	to the *and_tmat functionality and also changing the averaging
	over levels.  (Make average of all the source term on a level 
	rather than the individual elements.)
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/hybridscat/TestHybrid.arts: 
	Added new method to test
	
	* src/rte.{cc, h}:  Added scattering source for single level.
	Makes a lot of unecessary calls because of a failed check which
	is still being investigated...

2017-09-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-785

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake:

	Explicitly pass include path to ignore the environment variable
	ARTS_INCLUDE_PATH. Otherwise the test can break depending on the user's
	environment.

	Remove special cases for cmake 2.6 which we don't support anymore.

2017-09-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	Downgrade outlevel to 3.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/hybridscat/TestHybrid.arts:
	Set iy_main_agenda for yCalc using RT4 explicitly here (not rely on
	setting from an INCLUDE).

	inverses.

	* src/groups.cc:

	Added CovarianceMatrix class to groups.

	* src/m_oem.*:

	Adapted OEM to new covariance matrix class. This for now will break MPI version,

	* src/methods.cc (Touch, Ignore, iySurfaceFastem),
	src/workspace.cc (surface_type_mask),
	src/agendas.cc (surface_rtprop_sub_agenda0):
	Minor doc substantiations, spell fixes, etc.

2017-08-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-760

	* src/matpack{I,III,IV,V,VI,VII}.cc:

	Use std::fill_n instead of iterator loop for initialization with a
	Numeric in assignment operator of the non-view types. This was already
	done in the initialization constructor. Added here for consistency.
	Also replaced the iterator loops in the ctor with std::fill_n for
	better readability. The compiler generates the same code for both.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc:

	(ScatSpeciesScatAndMetaRead):

	Parallelize the reading of scattering data and meta data files. Gives a
	significant speedup (factor 2 - 10 depending on cores and filesystem
	performance) especially when reading lots of particles. Number of
	concurrent reads is limited to 16 to not put too much strain on the
	filesystem.

	Move output from out2 to out3 for less clutter.

	Use std::move to push local arr_ssd and arr_smd variables to the
	workspace variables. Avoids unnecessary copy operations. Note that
	std::move can only be used if the original variable is not needed
	anymore!

	(ScatElementsSelect):

	Use std::move to push local scat_meta_tmp and scat_data_tmp variables
	to the workspace variables. Avoids unnecessary copy operations.

	(ScatSpeciesExtendTemperature):

	Make ssdo a reference to SingleScatteringData to avoid unnecessary
	copying.

	Use std::move for assigning local variables T_grid_new and ssdn to
	avoid unnecessary copies.
	
	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_from_file):

	Assemble string before sending it into the output stream to avoid it
	being split up in multithreaded calls.

	* src/interpolation_poly.cc (gridpos_poly):

	Make non-changing interp order variable m const.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (chk_scat_data):

	All checks are working again.
	
	* src/rt4.cc:

	Add fixes for PropagationMatrix changes. Patch supplied by Richard.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc:

	Grid writing code for GriddedField3 was accidentally commented out and
	broke xml files.

	* arts-2-3-758
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/ReferenceJacobianInTestErrorJacobian.xml:

	Reverted changes to reference file from arts-2-3-757. The test case
	runs with the original values, but fails with the new values.

	This also breaks controlfiles.  Those directly using the propagation matrix
	
	Introducing new internal class and sub-class PropagationMatrix and
	StokesVector to handle propagation a bit more efficiently.  StokesVector
	is basically only there to easier convert from one to another.
	
	Note:  This lacks a lot of optimizations.  Only iyemissionstandard is optimized,
	the rest receives only moderat boosts.  In my own work predicting Martian parameter
	retrieval expectations using loads of RetrievalQuantity, I see around 
	50% speed increase, so a few tricks could help other code-paths speed-up some
	as well.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/ReferenceJacobianInTestErrorJacobian.xml:
	Changed because this committ altered the numbers (with same magnitude of the 
	change if you do perturbation calculations).
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added files
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Fix error found investigating catalog jacobian change
	
	* src/disort.cc:  Changed to use new classes: dtauc_ssalbCalc 
	
	* src/doit.{cc,h}:  Created temporary function rte_step_doit_replacement
	to replace rte_step_doit using new classes.  Basically the same thing but 
	without the need to create many local copies
	
	Changed to use new classes: cloud_fieldsCalc, cloud_RT_no_background,
	cloud_ppath_update1D_planeparallel
	
	* src/groups.cc:  Added new classes up to ArrayOfArrayOf*
	
	* src/linerecord.cc:  Fix for added quantum identifier for match all in
	match_lines_by_quantum_identifier
	
	* src/linerecord.h:  Added method for returning line quantum identifier
	
	* src/lineshapesdata.{cc,h}: Changed a lot.  Still work in progress.
	Will be namespace and make life easier for adding new methods...
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Changed to use new classes:  
	nlte_sourceFromTemperatureAndSrcCoefPerSpecies, 
	propmat_clearskyAddFromAbsCoefPerSpecies,
	propmat_clearskyInit,
	propmat_clearskyAddFaraday,
	propmat_clearskyAddParticles,
	propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly,
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc: Changed to use new classes: 
	propmat_clearskyAddFromLookup,
	propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc
	
	* src/m_cia.cc: Found bug in VMR stuff.  Still under debug-status...
	
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc: Changed to use new classes:

	 opt_prop_bulkCalc,
	 ext_matAddPart,
	 abs_vecAddPart,
	 ext_matAddGas,
	 abs_vecInit,
	 opt_prop_sptFromMonoData,
	 TestScatDataInterp,
	 
	 * src/m_rte.cc:  Changed to use new classes: 
	 iyEmissionStandard
	 
	 * src/m_transmitter.cc: Changed to use new classes:

	 iyTransmissionStandard
	 
	 * src/m_zeeman.cc: Changed to use new classes:

	 propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc
	 
	 * src/make_auto_md_cc.cc,src/make_auto_md_h.cc,src/make_auto_workspace_h.cc:
	 Includes propagationmatrix.h
	 
	 * src/montecarlo.cc:  Changed to use new classes:

	 * src/optproperties.{cc,h}:  Changed to use new classes: 
	 abs_vecTransform,
	 ext_matTransform,
	 opt_prop_sum_propmat_clearsky
	 
	 * src/partial_derivatives.{cc,h}:  Added species and isotopologue to
	 test.  otherwise, species with same quantum numbers but different
	 species/isotopologue's might add together.  Also fixed error where
	 only if the catalogue parameters were first in line and there was no
	 perturbation parameters work...
	 
	 * src/propagationmatrix.{cc,h}:  Added.  Contains implementations
	 of the class including some specific functions needed to operate
	 and manipulate the matrix/vectors
	 
	 Especially key functions include:
	 compute_transmission_matrix_and_derivative,
	 compute_transmission_matrix,
	 get_diydx_replacement
	 
	 * src/quantum.{cc,h}: Added QuantumIdentifier::operator< and 
	 QuantumIdentifier::operator> to mean contained in, and contains
	 (left<right means left is part of right and vice versa).  Also
	 added simple way to initialize a QuantumIdentifier and an ALL 
	 type of identifying all lines of a species-isotopologue
	 combination (rather than implementing an exception to the rule)
	 
	 * src/rte.cc: Separated ext_mat_case to its own function.
	 I think it is mostly not used by the new setup so it might be removed
	 at some point. ext2trans uses this function, so does get_ppath_trans.
	 
	 get_ppath_trans is also updated to use a list of PropagationMatrix
	 to get the transmission.
	 
	 get_ppath_pmat is updated to use new classes. So is 
	 get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat, get_ppath_ext, get_ppath_trans,
	 get_ppath_trans_and_dppath_trans_dx, get_ppath_trans2, and
	 get_ppath_trans2_and_dppath_trans_dx
	 
	 Finally, implemented emission_rtstep_replacement as a replacement
	 of emission_rtstep.  Does the same things but without copies when NLTE
	 is active
	 
	 * src/workspace.cc:  Changed to use new classes: 
	  abs_vec, 
	  abs_vec_spt, 
	  dpropmat_clearsky_dx, 
	  dnlte_dx_source, 
	  nlte_dsource_dx, 
	  ext_mat, 
	  ext_mat_spt,
	  nlte_source,
	  propmat_clearsky
	  
	  * XML-files:  Writing and reading for the new classes added 
	  with Oliver's help
	  
	  * src/zeeman.{cc,h}: xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper_with_zeeman
	  uses new classes.  Beginnings of implementations of an replacement
	  to use new LineFunctions namespace.  Not ready yet.

	THIS BREAKS CONTROLFILES USING RT4Calc*

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc*),
	rt4.[cc,h] (check_rt4_input, run_rt4, par_optpropCalc, sca_optpropCalc):
	Use new type scat_data. Removed use of spt_calc_agenda and
	opt_prop_part_agenda (replaced by opt_prop_sptFromScat_data and
	opt_prop_bulkCalc) and creation/use of scat_data_mono.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4.arts:
	Adapted to changes above. Removed definitions of unused agendas.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (opt_prop_bulkCalc):
	Removed unused interface parameter.

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc*),
	disort.[cc,h] (check_disort_input, dtauc_ssalbCalc, phase_functionCalc2,
	opt_prop_sptFromScat_data):
	Check scat_data_checked in check_disort_input, not later when used in
	subroutines. Completely remove use of opt_prop_part_agenda.

	(DisortCalc*, run_disort):
	Removed not any longer needed/used interface parameters.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Removed setting of unused opt_prop_part_agenda.

	* src/methods.cc (RT4Calc*, DisortCalc*):

       * src/xml_io_instantiation: Instantiation for xml io templates.

       * src/xml_io_types.h: Instantiation for xml io templates.

2017-08-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-755

	* src/array.h:

	Introduce C++11 move constructor and move assignment operator.

	* src/matpack{I,III,IV,V,VI,VII}.{cc,h}:

	Introduce move constructors and move assignment operators for all
	memory allocating types (all non-views).

	Since we know that the data of non-view types is stored in one
	continuous block of memory, std::memcpy is now used instead of iterator
	loops for data duplication in copy constructors and assignment
	operators of those types. This can give a significant speed boost
	depending on the calculation. For a radar calculation from Manfred,
	which uses ybatchCalc for 600 cases, the memcpy implementation gives
	almost a factor 2(!) speed up. This is mostly due to the fact that in
	each iteration ScatSpeciesMerge needs to be called. Since it uses
	scat_data as In+Out, the agenda engine has to make a full copy of the
	ArrayOfArrayOfSingleScatteringData for each batch case. Deep copies of
	SingleScatteringData are very expensive because it contains four
	Vectors, two Tensor5s and a Tensor7 which makes the performance
	advantage of using memcpy very noticeable.

	* src/optproperties.{cc,h} (opt_prop_sum_propmat_clearsky):

	Last argument was not passed by reference thus causing a Tensor4 copy
	on every call.

	* src/rational.h:

	Remove converting constructor Rational(int). It is redundant because a
	converting ctor for Index also exists.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (opt_prop_sptFromMonoData):

	Avoid copying of ext_mat_data and abs_vec_data to temporary variable in
	every iteration for the t_grid.nelem()==1 case. This code is called
	very often and the copy to a local variable can be completely avoided
	by moving the ext_matTransform call into the if and else blocks calling
	it with different arguments for the two cases.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFrom*):

	In all reading routines use std::move when pushing the temporary
	LineRecord to the abs_lines array. Avoids copying every line.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (inv, diagonalize):

	Only create variable n in debug mode. Avoids warning in release mode.

	* src/xml_io_array_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream):

	Use std::move in ArrayOfLineRecord reading routine to avoid an
	unnecessary copying of the LineRecord.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (particle_fieldCleanup):

	Remove unneeded local variable. If particle_field_in and
	particle_field_out are not pointing to the same variable, just copy
	p_f_i to p_f_o. Keeping p_f_i and p_f_o while looping over all elements
	is not necessary because the loop only operates on a single element at
	a time. Avoids two unneeded Tensor4 copies if p_f_i and p_f_o are the
	same WSV or one copy if they're not.

	f-dimensioning in these. Cosmetics.

	(pha_mat_sptFromScat_data):
	WSM for pha_mat extraction from new-type scat_data. For use in
	pha_mat_spt_agenda or to replace internal use of
	pha_mat_spt_From(Mono)Data).

	(opt_prop_bulkCalc):
	WSM reproducing the standard (and only one applied?) setup for
	opt_prop_part_agenda. Can be used within the agenda or in place of the
	agenda.

	* src/disort.cc (phase_functionCalc, phase_functionCalc2):
	Adapted for use of new-type scat_data, particularly in place of
	scat_data_mono. 

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Use new umbrella WSM opt_prop_bulkCalc in opt_prop_part_agenda (in a
	next step, the agenda call inside the ARTS interface will be replaced
	instead).

	* src/m_checked.cc, methods.cc (scat_data_checkedCalc:
	Some adaptations to current new-type scat_data state and assumptions.
	Updated built-in doc accordingly (for details see there).

	WARNING: This breaks scattering related controlfiles.

	More work towards pre-prepared scat_data. Specifically, started to
	modify DISORT interface to (exclusively) use pre-prepared scat_data
	(equals to replacing several agendas by hard-wired solutions).

	* src/[m_]disort.[cc,h]:
	Started to adapt for use of new, pre-interpolated scat_data.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (opt_prop_sptFromScat_data):
	Added. A temporary WSM for use of new scat_data in spt_calc_agenda.

	* src/optproperties.[cc,h] (scat_data_monoExtract):
	A (temporary?) method to extract scat_data_mono out of new type (ie
	already freq interpolated) scat_data, avoiding the interpolation
	overhead of scat_data_monoCalc.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Switch on use of negative pnd keyword. Switch of scat_data f_grid
	checks for new-type scat_data (they would fail) via user keyword.

	Can create unwanted side-effects in debug mode as discovered by Jana.

	Move a large part of the *agenda_execute functions into a separate

	after the other).

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Minor rewording of bulkprop non-zero outside cloudbox error message.

	* arts-2-3-736

	* 3rdparty/invlib/*: invlib update which fixes compile error
	with llvm libc++ and warnings encountered when building
	with clang++.

2017-06-22 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-735

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (psdMH97, psdF07):
	Added parametrization-T adjustment limits as user parameters.

	* src/methods.cc (psdMH97, psdF07, psdW16):
	Adapted to changes above. Adapted/improved built-in doc.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (psd_cloudice_MH97, psd_snow_F07):
	Removed Tc<0 requirement since math is sufficiently stable also for
	positive T. Removed final isnan check (NaN cases should be avoided
	before).

2017-06-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-734

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	The Intel compiler has value-unsafe floating-point optimizations
	enabled by 'factory-default' which leads to large discrepancies
	compared to gcc/clang for certain calcucations (esp. Jacobians).
	To avoid these inaccuracies we now set the option '-fp-model precise'
	by default.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts:

	Revert changes from previous commit. Not needed anymore with -fp-model
	precise.

2017-06-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-733

	* cmake/modules/FindBLAS.cmake, cmake/modules/FindLAPACK.cmake:

	Add modules from cmake master version ded9859. Adds support for
	OpenBLAS detection without introducing a dependency for ARTS on a
	newer cmake.

	* 3rdparty/relmat/module_error.F90:

	Add missing comma in format description. Fixes compile failure with
	Intel Fortran.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts:

	Increase BT comparison tolerance from 0.01 to 0.015 to account for
	numerical differences when using the Intel compiler.

2017-06-21 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-732

	* m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc:

	(pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields):
	Added W16 PSD. Adapted for merged F07 interface.

	(pndFromPsdBasic2):
	Added. An extended, more flexible version of pndFromPsdBasic. For
	testing. Work in progress.

	(pndAdjustFromScatMeta):
	Added. Allows to rescale calculated pnd values such that is represents
	given material content. For testing, to allow
	*pnd_fieldCalcFromBulkProperties* to reproduce what
	*pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields* used to do.

	(MassSizeParamsFromScatMeta):
	Added. WSM to calculatem-D's alpha and beta from the scat_meta info.
	Code mostly copied from pnd_fieldF07.

	(psdF07):
	Added. WSM analogous to psdMH97, but for F07 psd.

	(psdMH97):
	Temporarily introduced user parameter to switch off temperature
	adjustment.

	(pnd_fieldCalcFromParticleBulkProps):
	Bugfix in deriving flat indices in case of multiple scat_species.

	(dNdD_F07):
	Added. Merged the two F07* WSM and adapted to apply new psd_snow_F07.

	(dNdD_W16):
	Bugfix. psd_rain_W16 already returns dNdD for complete size grid; no
	need to call it per size entry.

	* cloudbox.cc,h:
	
	(pnd_fieldW16):
	Added. Interface from pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields to rain drop
	size distribution W16 (psd_rain_W16).

	(pnd_fieldF07):
	Merged both Field, 2007 methods into one (the only difference are some
	coefficients that have not even been handled here, but in the further
	submethods IWCtopnd_F07*). Removed useless "unit conversion factor" as
	this was anyway hardcoded to 1. Throw error if SWC<0 (in contrast to
	what the comments claimed, F07 formulas do not provide meaningful
	results at negative WC (rather NaN in my tests).

	(pnd_fieldMH97):
	Don't calculate dveq from mass, but take it from scat_meta.

	(psd_snow_F07):
	Renamed from IWCtopnd_F07* and merged both these Field, 2007 core
	methods. Changed to handle a grid of sizes at once.

	(bin_integral):
	Renamed from 'scale_pnd' (as it's more general applicable than just
	for psd to pnd integration) and separated the node (or bin) weight
	calculation from the actual integration into it's own method.
	Generalized doc accordingly.

	(bin_quadweights):
	Added. The separated node/bin weight calculation for bin_integral.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.ybatch.ref.xml:
	Updated. Using vol_equ_diameter from scat_meta instead of calculating
	dveq from mass makes a slightly larger difference than the 0.01K
	threshold.

2017-06-21  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-731
	
	* src/lin_alg.cc:  Added solution by Philippe Baron on matrix exponent
	for RT using a Cayley-Hamilton theorem fit to eigenvalues and 
	coefficients.  Both explicit and Eigen solutions are available.
	The Eigen solution is faster despite technically performing more
	operations and copying in my test cases [by 10%].  
	
	Speed-up in simple test of 1,000,000 computations: 24 sec for
	old method, 0.9 sec for new method.  Single core.
	
	* src/rte.cc: Updated to use new matrix exponent.  Please revert if this
	breaks anyones test case (and send me the test case).  Description of the
	method can be found in the functions in lin_alg.cc.  The Eigen-code should
	also be fairly straightforward to read
	
	Note:  there is a lot of copying going on in the trans_mat calculations
	because we are sending in A=-K*r, where K is a constant.  Same for the 
	jacobians, in which case the copying is multiplied by a lot.  I wonder 
	if we should redesign the matrix exponent, or at least the interface in
	rte.cc, to explicitly expect K rather than A=-K*r?

2017-06-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-730

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Simplify BLAS/LAPACK detection. Only look for LAPACK, because it itself
	checks for BLAS anyway. No need checking for both ourselves.
	Also, remove additional Cblas detection which created more problems
	than it solved.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Remove BLAS_LIBRARIES variable as blas libraries are listed in
	LAPACK_LIBRARIES variable.

2017-06-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

2017-06-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-728

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat): Made a switch to use,
	get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat that is needed for handling remaining
	jacobians. Changes below side-effects. But the switch made the
	calculations nearly double as long. Reason should be checked.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard):
	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid): Adopted call of get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat.

	Rolled back to only-warning and return to clearsky calc if scatt solvers
	are called with cloudbox off (as used pre arts-2-3-633).

2017-06-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-714

	* particle_bulkprop_field and particle_bulkprop_names are now
	semi-mandatory variables, i.e. they must at least be set to be
	empty in line with e.g. the wind fields.

	* src/m_oem.cc (x2artsScatSpecies): Removed. Obselete after
	changing x2artsStandard.

	(x2artsStandard): Now handling scattering species. The method now
	also considers atmfields_checked, atmgeom_checked, cloudbox_on and
	cloudbox_checked.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit): Adopted call of cloudbox_checkedCalc.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Added checks of
	particle_bulkprop_field and particle_bulkprop_names.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (pnd_fieldCalcFromParticleBulkProps): Added
	comment, to explain why this method contains a lot of checks.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: particle_bulkprop_field and
	particle_bulkprop_names added. Set to be empty.

2017-06-09  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-713

	* 3rdparty/relmat/*: Updated to latest version

	* src/lineshapesdata.{cc,h}: Added LineFunctions helper class because
	I keep having to rewrite code for special cases.  Can handle line shapes,
	line strengths, line mixing, Zeeman, and their derivatives presently but
	only used by m_linemixing.cc to simplify those calculations.  Some  
	todos to integrate with rest of ARTS if desired (it simplifies computations 
	significantly, or at least makes them readable easier).  Lacks 
	cutoff-frequencies and purely real line shapes.  Also the generalization
	to line specific partial derivatives needs to take the quantumidentifiers 
	still.  Beta code in other words.
	
	* src/complex.h: Added ArrayOfComplex{Vector,Matrix}
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc: Making use on parts of lineshapesdata.{cc,h} to simplify
	reading.  Still left with a lot of old code commented out for easy switching 
	since I am still testing it.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.h: Added some more checks

2017-06-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-712

	* doc/uguide/cloudradar.tex: Rudimentary update of the chapter.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat): Now allows that
	cloudbox_on = 0. But note some calculations will be done even in
	this case, such as calculation of ppath. And if there is any
	iy_aux_var, the full method is run.

2017-06-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-711

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add better Threads detection. The pthread library needed by

	* src/binio.cc (binostream::float2ieee_single):

	Remove deprecated 'register' keyword.

2017-06-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-710

	Make C++11 compiler support a requirement. This utilizes the macros
	CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD, CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED, CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS
	available since cmake 3.1.0.

	Add status output whether OEM is enabled.

	* src/main.cc (main):

	Remove C++11 support output from feature list because it is not
	optional anymore.

	Changed two loops to test C++11 range-based for loops.

	* src/m_fos.cc: Include m_xml.h for WriteXML. Fixes unresolved
	reference with Intel compiler.

	modified gamma distribution. Both ported from Matlab code in CloudARTS
	and Atmlab, respectively.

	(psd_cloudice_MH97):
	Rename former IWCtopnd_MH97 / psdFromMH97 once more.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc (dNdD_W16):
	Added. Wrapper WSM for Wang16 rain PSD.
	(dNdD_MH97):

2017-06-07 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-705

	* src/cloudbox.[cc,h] (psdFromMH97):
	Revised and renamed old IWCtopnd_MH97. Now takes a Vector of sizes.
	More rigid behaviour for out-of-bounds input parameters, pushing all
	responsibility to handle/fix them to calling function.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (dNdD_MH97):
	Adapted to apply new psdFromMH97 conserving old behaviour.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc:
	Adapted to apply new psdFromMH97.

	* src/methods.cc: Cosmetical fixes.

2017-06-07  Simon Pfreundschuh <simonpf@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-703

	* src/m_oem.cc: Added guards to keep isnan macro out of invlib code.

2017-06-07  Simon Pfreundschuh <simonpf@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-702

	* src/oem.h(ArtsLog): Some cosmetical fixes for the logging class.

	break other code that uses the std:: prefix for the isnan and isinf functions.

2017-06-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-701

	* src/m_oem.cc (x2artsScatSpecies): New WSM.

	not work with no jacobian calculations.

2017-06-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-700

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radmat.f:

	Rename daxpy and dswap to rt4_* to avoid name clash with function from
	external BLAS library. Avoids possible segfaults due to implementation
	differences. Reported by Patrick and Simon.

2017-06-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-699

	* First radar jacobian in place. So far just considering the
	change in back-scattering, effect on attenuation of both gases and
	particles to be added.

	[But still happy as I spent 5 hours on bug hunting, finding that
	all had been correct from start. I just strongly under-estimated
	the particle attenuation and my test did not work as expected.]

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat): Work around jacobian
	calculations.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yActive): Added geo_pos_agenda as input.
	y_f, y_geo etc. now set. Now alos jacobian quantities processed
	and the jacobian matrix is compiled.

	* src/workspace.cc: Updated and polished text for *y_geo*.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc): Default for y_geo is now NAN, instead of -99999.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink, iyTransmissionStandard):
	Initial check of iy_transmission now using .empty.

2017-06-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-698

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyActiveSingleScat): Renamed iyCloudRadar,
	as the method is not restriced to neither clouds or radars.

	(yActive): Renamed iyCloudRadar, for same reason as above. Added
	jacobian_do as input. Added y_f, y_pol, y_pos, y_los, y_geo and
	jacobian as output. Started to add handling of these variables.

	* src/workspace.cc: Improved unit part of *iy*.

2017-06-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-697

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid, fos):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard):
	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard, iyRadioLink):
	Adopted calls of the two functions below, by adding even more
	dummy variables.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_ext): Added ppath_dpnd_dx as output
	argument and dpnd_field_dx as input. Added handling of
	ppath_dpnd_dx.

	(get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat): Added ppath_dpnd_dx as output
	argument and dpnd_field_dx as input.

2017-06-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-696

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): The reference dielectric
	factor can now be specied directly, and not just be calculated by
	MPM93 refractive index. The new feature is needed to mimic e.g.
	CloudSat data. Extended built-in doc significantly regarding
	units.

	(yCloudRadar): Switched to new version. The difference is that
	binning is done differently. This is now done with
	integration_bin_by_vecmult, that should be both faster and more
	accurate.

	In fact, in my test case I noticed clear deviations when comparing
	to old bin scheme, when using more wide bins. And it was the old
	scheme that failed, it e.g. did not conserve the integrated Ze.

	That is, the previous version did not work properly! I have not
	tried to find the exact reason.

2017-06-02 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-695

	* src/rte.[cc,h] (get_ppath_scat_source_fixT):
	Make separate function for optimized pha_mat_spt extraction without

	* src/m_fos.cc, methods.cc (iyHybrid):
	Add keyword pfct_method to allow choosing pha_mat_spt temperature
	adaptation method and calls to respective get_ppath_scat_source*
	functions. Made median-T-point extraction the default.

2017-06-02 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-694

	* src/m_optproperties.cc, methods.cc (pha_mat_dataFrom*):
	Introduced non-T-interpolation option (governed via rtp_temperature
	variable; see online doc) in order to allow speedier pha_mat
	extraction (and, specifically, to be able optimize the amount of
	pha_mat_spt extraction in iyHybrid - perfomring that only once instead
	of per each ppath grid point).

2017-06-02 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-693

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_scat_source):
	Remove scaling of scat source per scat element with its pnd, ie
	outputting scat source one single particle of each element. Removes
	requirement of separately calculating and storing dppath_scat_source.
	For jacobians, do NOT skip pha_mat_spt and ppath_scat_source calcs for
	pnd=0.
	Bugfix in incoming field p-interpolation.

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid):
	Some code for layer bulk source calculation for applying in scat
	source in RT solution.

	* src/rt4.cc:
	Layout fixes for a couple of error/info messages.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yCloudRadarNew): New version of
	yCloudRadar, not yet active.

	* src/sensor.cc (integration_bin_by_vecmult): Varoius changes, now
	seems to work. And now also handles decreasing grids.

2017-06-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-691

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid), rte.[cc,h] (get_ppath_scat_source):
	Moved all scat source calculation stuff into an individual function.

2017-06-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-690

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid):
	Implemented scat source term calculation (not jacobians capable yet).

2017-06-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-689

	* src/sensor.cc (integration_bin_by_vecmult): New function. So far
	just coding, no testing done.

	(sensor_integration_vector2): Removed this
	function. It was not used in any way. Seems that it was an old
	version of the function, before normalisation of x_f was
	introduced.

	(summation_by_vecmult):
	(integration_func_by_vecmult): Renaming of two old functions. They
	before started with sensor_, but they are not limited to sensor
	calculations.

	* src/sensor.cc: Changes in sevaral functions due to renaming above.

2017-06-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-688

	* src/rt4.cc:
	General cleanup from (outcommented and active) couts.

	(sca_optpropCalc):
	Bugfix I. Affected calculations with "semi-bad" normed RT4 scattering
	matrices (ie cases that did pass the error threshold, but were bad
	enough to trigger a out2 warning message and by that unintentionally
	skip the renormalization), which easily occured when increasing
	pfct_threshold to avoid the bad-norm error throwing. :(((
	Good thing: RT4 results are more stable over nstreams now. Bad thing:
	complete (re)normalisartion takes time, i.e. calculations take
	noticeably longer now.
	Bugfix II. Calculate complete scattering matrix structure when
	auto_inc_stream limit is hit, but calculation shall be executed (aka
	robust=1) anyways.

	* src/m_rt4.cc:
	Made pfct_threshold an internal global constant (to avoid inconsistent
	settings in the different RT4Calc* methods).

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radscat4.f, radtran4.f:
	Remove outcommenting of info message inside CHECK_NORM. instead,
	outcomment call of it as such (no sense to call it and spend comp time
	when it has zero effect anyways). Cleaned out some earlier added
	comments/write statements.

	* src/m_surface.cc, methods.cc
	(surface_reflectivityFromSurface_rmatrix):
	Vector method equivalent to
	surface_scalar_reflectivityFromSurface_rmatrix. Not in effect so far
	(as in the end i didn't need it and was not sure whether the approach
	is correct like this in the general, aka non-scalar, case.

	Mistral supercomputer when compiling with Intel C++.
	^^^^^ Please let me know if this change creates problems in LaPack
	detection for any other configurations.

	* src/m_general.cc (Print):

	Timer output for system time was always zero. Thanks to clang-tidy for
	the info. :-)

	* arts-2-3-681

	* src/rt4.cc,h (run_rt4):
	When auto-adapting internal stream number, for higher freqs start from
	where previous freq ended (higher freqs have stronger PFCT peaks need
	more directions for proper norm conservation).
	Add robust keyword for auto-adapt case.

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Calc*):
	Add robust keyword (for auto_inc_nstreams case).

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyHybrid):

	* src/workspace.cc: Added also particle_bulkprop and particle_bulkprop_names.

2017-05-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-669

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (pndFromPSD, psdMH97): Started.

	* Added some variables for moving towards tests of scattering
	jacobians. So far just handling one scattering species, and
	temporary naming and no documentation text written. pnd_agenda is
	now defined to cover one point, but it should be consider to
	instead let it cover multiple points to decrease the overhead due
	to repeated checks.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added pnd_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added dpnd_dx, dpsd_dx, pnd_agenda, pnd,
	pnd_input, pnd_input_names, psd and psd_grid.

2017-05-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-668

	* More work on scattering jacobians.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Introduced new variables and
	adopted call of get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians.

	* src/jacobian.cc (get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians): Added
	scat_species_i and nscats as functiuon arguments.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink):
	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): t_nlte_field_dumme renamed to
	t_nlte_field_empty, and clearly init to be empty. Introduced new
	variables and adopted call of
	get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianAddScatSpecies)
	(jacobianCalcScatSpeciesAnalytical): New methods. So far just
	coding, no testing at all.

2017-05-26  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-667

	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Updated to perform calculations with ordered
	line mixing output from RELMAT.  This avoids some complications that
	are probably numerical in nature that we encounter with the full
	approach...

	* src/methods.cc:  Updated interface to the line mixing code

	* 3rdparty/relmat/*:  Using Teresa's latest version

2017-05-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-666

	* BUG fix!!! The transmission in iyCloudRadar was incorrect. No
	error if cloudbox covered complete atmosphere, otherwise simulated
	backscattering was somewhat too high.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): tr_rev was only updated
	inside the cloudbox. This effectively resulted in an
	under-estimation of gas attenuation in one of the directions.

	Also, removed use_mean_scatdata as input and more coding to
	prepare for jacobians.

	(pnd_field_from_ppdata): Start on function to fill pnd_field using
	agendas to be added.

2017-05-24 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-665

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Calc*),
	src/rt4.cc,h (run_rt4):
	First complete version with internal automatic increase of nstreams if
	requested and needed. Not tested yet. Nothing broken in non-increase
	version, it seems (phew).

2017-05-24 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-664

	WORK IN PROGRESS. Towards a more robust RT4. Can break controlfiles.

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Calc*),
	src/rt4.cc,h (run_rt4, sca_optpropCalc):
	After misuse by experts, removed pfct_threshold as user parameter,
	but hardcoded to a value that proofed to make sense. Instead, allow
	internal automatic increase of number of streams in order to have the
	scattering matrix being able to properly reproduce the expected norm.
	Done individually per frequency.

2017-05-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-663

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): A small first step towards

	* src/montecarlo.cc (pha_mat_singleCalcScatElement)
	(pha_mat_singleCalc): The old pha_mat_singleCalc was seperated into
	two functions, to make it possible to also obtain the phase
	function for each scattering element without duplication of code.

	* arts-2-3-660

	* CMakeLists.txt, config.h.cmake, src/CMakeLists.txt, src/m_oem.cc,
	src/main.cc:

	Separate C++11 support from OEM support. Before, C++11 support had to
	be forcibly disabled for clang because invlib doesn't compile with it.
	Now, only OEM, not C++11, is disabled by default if clang is used.
	It can be reenabled for testing with clang with -DENABLE_OEM=1 .

	* CMakeLists.txt, README:

	Add support for ccache (-DENABLE_CCACHE=1). https://ccache.samba.org/

	* src/array.h: Add std:: before fill calls.

	* src/m_doit.cc (OptimizeDoitPressureGrid, doit_scat_fieldCalc,
	doit_scat_fieldCalcLimb), m_optproperties.cc (DoitScatteringDataPrepare,
	TestScatDataInterp):
	Pulled the temperature interpolation of the phase matrix out of the 
	interation loop	in DOIT. The interpolation of the phase matrix is now
	done in DoitScatteringDataPrepare, so before the loop. Before it was
	interpolated in doit_scat_fieldCalc and doit_scat_fieldCalcLimb. 
	This saves a lot of time for DOIT. The phase matrix is now stored in a 
	new WS variable, pha_mat_doit. 

	* src/methods.cc: 
	Changed the methods according to the change above

	* src/workspace.cc:
	Added new WS variable pha_mat_doit

	ATTENTION: Breaks backward compatability of RT4-using controlfiles.

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc, rt4.[cc,h] (RT4Init, RT4Calc,
	RT4CalcWithRT4Surface; check_rt4_input, init_ifield):
	Remove RT4Init (got too error-prone with many generic input variables
	that needed to be consistent between Init and Calc, and no real use
	here of having a separate Init WSM). Moved functionality into
	check_rt4_input and init_ifield instead.

	* arts-2-3-648

	* src/m_doit.cc, methods.cc (iyInterpCloudboxField):
	Throw error if angle interpolation order exceeds number of available
	grid points. Make extrapolfac for za angle poly-interpolation a user
	parameter, default set to 1.0 which should satisfy all of RT4's quad
	types. Check that za interpolant within given inter/extrapolation
	range and throw error otherwise.

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc, rt4.[cc,h] (RT4Init, RT4Calc,
	RT4CalcWithRT4Surface; check_rt4_input):
	Make adding of zenith/nadir as RT4 user angles optional (together with
	the extrapolation of angle grid above this should allow for
	scat_za_grids that are not bound by 0/180degs).

	* src/m_doit.cc, methods.cc (iyInterpLinCloudboxField,
	iyInterpCloudboxField):
	Renamed iyInterpLinCloudboxField from iyInterpCloudboxField. New
	iyInterpCloudboxField using free-order polynomials (gridpos_poly) for
	angle interpolation and offering options for restricting zenith angle
	interpolation to respective hemisphere. Default reproduces
	iyInterpLinCloudboxField results. Higher order and options still need
	to be tested.

	* src/interpolation_poly.[cc,h] (gridpos_poly_longitudinal,
	gridpos_poly_cyclic_longitudinal):
	Added single point interpolation version for longitudinal
	interpolation.

	As for RT4 in arts-2-3-639, make separate Disort interace WSM for
	different surface handling approaches. Common functionality moved into
	subroutines. All surface data prep moved into a subroutines.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:

	* 3rdparty/relmat/CMakeList.txt:  Added OpenMP.
	
	* 3rdparty/relmat/*:  Now with the linearization method 
	that Teresa has been working on.  Also, now 
	with the promise to be silent if not given a debug flag.
	The same debug flag then reports - by binary - if the 
	program ran into errors or not.  For unknown reasons,
	the new error checking makes RELMAT run one order of
	magnitude slower.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc: adapted for the new error handling.
	Also added two helper functions
	(SetBandIdentifiersAuto) and (SetRelaxationMatrixCalcType)
	to help user set the bands to every band and select to 
	use the linearization method or Hartmann-Tran method.
	
	* src/quantum{cc,h}:  Helper function 
	(SetFromStringForCO2Band) now available to easily set CO2 
	bands from standard notations for CO2.

	surface property handling (RT4CalcWithRT4Surface).

	* src/rt4.[cc,h] (check_rt4_input, get_quad_angles, run_rt4):

2017-02-20  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-635
	
	* src/complex.{cc,h}: Added mult for different matrix-matrix-matrix
	combinations of complex and normal matrices.  Also renamed StrideType
	to ComplexStrideType
	
	* src/continua.cc: renamed real and complex to real_t and complex_t
	because Eigen complains that real and complex overwrites things.
	I could not see any problems in testing but I have no idea what
	these copies of C-types are doing since continua.cc is a tad difficult
	to follow.  (I cannot even "meld" it to point at the differences
	without producing warnings in Chinese...)
	
	* src/lin_alg.{cc,h}: Added matrix diagonalize that returns
	the eigenvalue derivatives is fed the derivatives of the original
	matrix.  I am still trying to get eigenvector derivatives working
	but I do not understand the normalization of the paper and get
	errors on the order of 1e15...
	
	Also added (matrix_exp_4x4) and (propmat4x4_to_transmat4x4) for 
	explicitly 4x4 matrices after reading Eigen documentation.  These
	are about 3 times as fast as their general equivalence using ARTS
	types.  There might still be data copying issues in these 
	implementations... the improvements are because 4x4 matrices have
	analytical solutions and because Eigen use processor vectorizations
	to repeat operations (if I understand this correctly).
	
	Also, removed #pragma in my old 
	special_matrix_exp_and_dmatrix_exp_dx_for_rt because it actually 
	made it even slower (with it on, the new code was 10x faster, now 
	it is only 3x for extreme cases).
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Added support for temperature and wind 
	partial derivatives in the xsec calculations.  This is still 
	considered to be in testing mode as there is just perturbations
	for temperature before I solve the eigenvector derivatives thing.
	
	* src/matpackI.{cc,h}:  Is now including Eigen, in an order that did 
	not crash on my system.  I hope this works for others.  To 
	use Eigen for normal matrices and complex matrices, use 
	MapToEigen* functions.  Use MapToEigen4x4 for mapping 4x4 matrices
	if you know this is the size to improve speed.
	(Would this help as an option in mult?)
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.h: added supportsRelaxationMatrix() to
	check jacobian requests.  Relaxation matrix do not yet support line
	parameter partials.
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Added check to see if stokes_dim is 4 to use the 
	speedier calculations.  I do not think this has improved the 
	speed of the tests.

	* arts-2-3-633

	* src/methods.cc, m_disort.cc (DisortCalc),
	disort.[cc,h] (surf_albedoCalc):
	Revised interfacing to Disort surface handling, adding an option to
	derive albedo as total power reflection coefficient according to the
	given setting of surface_rtprop_agenda. Done to allow consistent
	surface setup between different solvers. However, results are rather
	unsatisfactory for any specular surface (the worse the higher the
	reflectivity).

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc,DisortInit),
	src/m_doit.cc (DoitCalc,DoitInit), src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc,RT4Init):
	Throw an error when called with cloudbox off, instead of semi-silently
	going on with a clearsky calculation. When one of them is called, it
	is safe to assume that an scattering calculation is expected to actually
	be performed (and not skipped). 

	* src/rt4.cc (surf_optpropCalc):
	Fixed internal doc.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Adapted to Disort surface handling changes above.

2017-02-15 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-632

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc):
	Bugfix in specular surface part. Make this work with f_grid.nelem()>1.

	(RT4Test): Switch rt4_test back on.

	* src/rt4.cc (rt4_test):
	Revised to make consistent again with the modified RT4 fortran
	interface.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4.arts:
	Switch performing RT4Test back on.

2017-02-15 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-631

	Revised RT4 interface such that it can use surface_rtprop_agenda,
	hence allows (with certain limitations) consistent calculations
	with ARTS' proprietary scattering solvers DOIT and MC. Currently it is
	"only" an option to do so, alternatively RT4's own surface handling can
	be used, where also Fresnel is now possible to be used and a (plain)
	specular version has been added in analogy to Fresnel and ARTS' plain
	specular implementation. Keeping the interface to RT4's own surface
	handling is primarily thought for testing purposes. Keeping this comes
	with the downside that each method uses different input parameters,
	which all have to be set within ARTS despite not applying them (WSM
	Touch is suggested to achieve this).

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc):
	Complete revision of surface handling as described above.

	* src/rt4.cc (surf_optpropCalc):
	Added. Surface reflection matrix and emission vector preparation
	following surface_rtprop_agenda for use in RT4.

	(rt4_test):
	Temporarily commented out call of RT4. Interface need to be adapted to
	new situation.

	* src/rt4.h:
	Added surf_optpropCalc. Adapted radtrano_. Added interface to RT4's
	planck function.
	
	* src/m_append.h:
	Added implementation for Matrix-to-Tensor3 and Tensor3-toTensor3
	appending. Corrected error message for Tensor4-to-Tensor4 appending.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Updated RT4Calc and Append according to above. Added more info on
	TestScatDataInterp. Spell fixes here and there.

	* src/workspace.cc, m_surface.cc, surface.cc, doit.cc, optproperties.cc:
	Minor polishing.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f:
	Modified interface and surface prep calls to handle other than RT4's
	own Lambertian and Fresnel reflection surfaces.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radutil4.f[.orig]:
	Added routines to prepare surface reflection and ground radiance
	tensors for plain specular reflection and for externally prepared
	reflection data.
	Keeping a copy of the original code.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4.arts:
	Adapt to work with revised RT4 surface handling & to apply
	surface_rtprop_agenda as default.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/indivfieldsatmo_setup.arts:
	Do correct setting of surface_scalar_reflectivity here, not set here
	one way and overwrite later, that's just confusing.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Remove re-setting of surface_scalar_reflectivity.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts:
	Add a predefinition for specular surface vector case. Update info on
	Lambertian surface predefinitions.

	* arts-2-3-630
	
	* 3rdparty/relmat/CMakeLists.txt:  With Oliver's help, parallelizatoin
	of the line mixing calculations over pressure levels is now possible.
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: Changed so that arrays of length 1 also works as the 
	gridded fields when adding particulates to abs species.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc: Minor changes.  There will be more here once
	I have got a clearer idea of how to deal with the jacobian.
	As before, this is not ready yet.

2017-02-10  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-629
	
	Decent cross-sections with 3rdparty/relmat is now a thing.  We need some
	more tests after a second implementation is done.
	
	* 3rdpart/relmat/arts_interface.F90:  Changed name of interface function
	to indicate the type of line mixing it is performing.
	
	* src/{pressurebroadeningdata,linerecord}.{cc,h}:  Finally got around
	to renaming a few functions.  The pressurebroadening structure now 
	has got easy tests of the type for use outside the pressure broadening 
	routines.  For now, only air broadening works with relmat so we have
	to ensure that this is what we've got there.  I also commented things a
	bit more in the pressurebroadening class so people can perhaps follow
	what the functions do easier.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc: Now seems to be working.  We recommend no one tries 
	this out before we have had more time to test that idea.  Remaining work 
	to be sure, especially in how to parallelize this efficiently.

2017-02-09  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-628
	
	* 3rdparty/relmat/: Updated by Teresa and it is now working mostly as 
	expected, comparing well with other implementations if similar code.
	
	* src/{absorption,linemixingdata,methods}.cc}:  Changed so negative 
	lm_p_lim now gives  extrapol factor for line mixing that is interpolated.  
	THIS MIGHT BREAK CONTROLFILES THAT WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO WORK ANYWAYS. 
	Please set lm_p_lim as a negative value to extrapolate results.
	Feature requested by Freddy.  I strongly recommend against using this.
	
	* src/{complex.{cc,h,lin_alg.cc}}:  With Oliver's help, there is now 
	proper mapping to Eigen matrices.  This means that mult, inv, and 
	diagonalize behave as expected for Complex Matrices and vectors.
	Note:  mult(A, A, A) now works but should be used with care since
	it creates memory inside Eigen.  Use only if you know what you 
	are doing.  The old behavior should not increase memory usage by 
	using A.noalias() flag.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc: Made a const static.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Almost got the cross-sections working here.
	We are only 10-orders of magnitude away from the target!  Code is 
	still riddle with output and other debuggin information. Do not use.
	Work still in progress.

	* arts-2-3-618

	* WORK IN PROGRESS!!!  TestMonteCarloDataPrepare, TestRteCalcMC and
	TestTMatrix are currently failing.

	* src/cloudbox.cc, src/m_cloudbox.cc, src/m_disort.cc,
	src/m_optproperties.cc, src/m_rt4.cc, src/m_tmatrix.cc, src/methods.cc,
	src/montecarlo.cc, src/optproperties.{cc,h}, src/rt4.cc, src/rte.cc,

2017-02-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-617

	* WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

	* Jana and me are currently working on introducing SingleScatteringData
	version 3. Therefore, temporarily horizontally_aligned data can't be
	written from ARTS.

	That means that TestMonteCarloDataPrepare, TestRteCalcMC and
	TestTMatrix are currently failing.

	* optproperties.{cc,h}:

	Copied PTypeFromString to PType2FromString.

	Adapted PTypeFromString and PTypeToString to SingleScatteringData
	format 3: "horizontally_aligned" -> "azimuthally_random",
	"macroscopically_isotropic" -> "totally_random".

	(ConvertAzimuthallyRandomSingleScatteringData):

	Added skeleton for conversion of older SingleScatteringData to
	version 3.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc:

	Added reading/writing support for SingleScatteringData version 3.

	Temporarily throw a runtime error if azimuthally_random data is tried
	to be written.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts:

	Replaced "horizontally_aligned" by "azimuthally_random".

2017-02-01  Alex Bobryshev  <oleksandr.bobryshev@uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-616
	
	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/TestMetMM.arts: in the comments
	added the link to the documentation of met_mm_accuracy.

2017-02-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-615

	* Summary: surface_skin_t is now an output of surface_rtprop_agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Removed all agendas
	demanding that surface_skin_t is pre-set. That does not work now.
	Either set value inside the agenda, or copy from another variable.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4.arts: Copied code
	from TestDISORT.arts to set surface_skin_t.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts: Now making
	use of t_surface in setting of surface_skin_t.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/stokesrot/TestSensorPol.arts:
	Adopted definition of surface_rtprop_agenda.

	* src/m_surface.cc
	(surface_rtpropCallSubAgendaX,surfaceSemiSpecularBy3beams):
	Adopted call of surface_rtprop_agenda by adding surface_skin_t as
	WSM output.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda):
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral):
	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_surface): Adopted call of
	surface_rtprop_agenda by introducing a local variable.

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc): Added surface_skin_t as input. This
	replaces to take surface temperature from t_field.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added surface_skin_t as output of
	surface_rtprop_agenda and its sub-agendas.

2017-02-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-614

	* doc/uguide/surface.tex, rte_theory.tex:
	Some fixes in surface reflection documentation.

	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_surface):
	Bugfix in doit_i_field_mono update.

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc):
	Put FORTRAN routine call (radtrano_) in critical environment (Patrick
	reports SEGFAULT crash otherwise when arts is run in multi-thread
	mode. Not sure anymore, though, why the critical environment was
	there already, but commented out...).

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f:
	Allow larger atm system: increased max number of atm layers to 300.

2017-02-02  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-613

	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Updated pressure from Pascal to atm to fit with
	relmat input.  Bug fix.

2017-02-01  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-612

	* src/m_gridded_fields.h: Workspace methods related to GriddedFields.

	Added the WSMs `GriddedFieldGetName` and `ArrayOfGriddedFieldGetNames` to
	get the names of GriddedFields during an ARTS run.

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc: Added `m_gridded_fields.h` to include list.

	* src/methods.cc: Added documentation for new workspace methods.

2017-01-31  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-611
	
	* src/complex.cc:  Changed the multiplications to be done by Eigen.
	Used to be broken code since unknown updates ago.
	
	* src/lin_alg.cc: Added dependency on Eigen/Eigenvalues and Eigen/Dense.
	Updated the complex versions of inv(Ainv, A) and diagonalize(P, W, A).
	The non-complex has to be friendly with a lot of classes to work as wanted.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Looking at (calculate_xsec_from_W) to make it work
	with the relaxation matrix now that the linear algebra works.  
	Work in progress...
	
	* 3rdpart/relmat/*: Added LAPACK/BLAS to Teresa's compiling options.
	Should help with future updates.  The rest contains some of Teresa's
	other updates.  Work in progress...
	
2017-01-31  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-610

	* 3rdparty/Eigen/:

	Added the remaining files of the Eigen template library (version 3.2.7).
	Requested by Richard to calculate Eigenvalues. Since we already use
	parts of the Eigen library (in matpackII.h), it makes most sense to
	include the whole library for convenience. It is also much easier to
	use than the low-level LaPack functions.

	Also added the COPYING.* files from the original source.

2017-01-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-609

	* cmake/scripts/update_doxyfile.cmake,
	doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in:

	Check if dot tool is installed. Set HAVE_DOT accordingly.
	Fixes flood of messages 'sh: 1: dot: not found' on Linux if dot tool is
	not installed. Bug reported by Richard.

2017-01-27  Stefan Buehler  <stefan.buehler(at)uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-608

	* controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts: Added path to
	INCLUDED hirs_fast.arts (from top level include directory), so
	that the file can be copied to another working directory and run
	from there.

2017-01-27  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-607
	
	* 3rdparty/relmat/*:  Update of files by Teresa.  Removes 
	reading routines and fix input.
	
	* ChangeLog:  It is 2017 now... fixed that miss.

2017-01-27  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-606
	
	* 3rdparty/relmat/arts_interface.F90:  Added mass parameter to let 
	the code compile.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Updated (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLineMixedBands)
	to send more information to the Fortran interface.
	
	* src/constants.cc:  Added flag for electrons and particulates for
	the special species jacobian calculations.
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}: Added flag for special species in 
	(get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians).  Also changed some
	wording/enums to make the code easier to follow.
	
	* src/m_{rte,transmitter}.cc: Changed so that the new wording is in 
	effect.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc: Added (jacobianAddConstantVMRAbsSpecies) and 
	(jacobianAddSpecialSpecies) for different additions to jacobian. I
	was hoping to add independently scaling integrated VMR values but
	not enough time to solve what this means for the integration.
	Constant numbers are just a copy of catalog parameter behavior 
	and so they are easy.  I might return to this later for the 
	scaling effects I wanted to look at.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc: Have (propmat_clearskyAddParticles) return the 
	partial derivaitves needed for the calculations.  Updated the rest
	of the code for new namings.  Note that you are not allowed to choose
	what unit the special absorbers return their derivatives in because
	neither (propmat_clearskyAddFaraday) nor (propmat_clearskyAddParticles)
	uses rtp_vmr to contain VMR values.  In *Faraday
	these values are the number densities by default and in *Particles
	the default is whatever unit was used in the input.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}:  Updated naming.

2017-01-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-605

	* src/m_oem.cc (OEM): Fix dummy function arguments for non-OEM builds.

2017-01-27  Simon Pfreundschuh  <simonpf@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-604

	* 3rdparty/invlib/*:
	Updated invlib version to current
	  development status.

	* src/agenda_wrapper.h:

	(AgendaWrapper):
	Avoid recomputation of Jacobian on forward model
	  evaluation.
	Implemented caching of Jacobian and yf vector provided
	  on creation.

	* src/methods.cc

	(OEM):
	Added oem errors output argument, that is used to store
	  errors encountered during OEM execution.

	* src/m_oem.cc

	(oem_template)
	Added error handling oem computation.
	Fixed returning of diagnostic values.
	Fixed storing of gamma factor for the
	  Levenberg-Marquardt method.

	* src/oem.h

	(ArtsLog)
	Added invlib logging class to adapt logging
	  output to Arts requirements.
	(handle_nested_exception)
	Generic error handling function, that converts nested
	  exception to a vector of strings.

	* src/workspace.cc

	(oem_errors)
	Added oem_errors WSV.

2017-01-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-603

	* src/agenda_class.cc:

	(Agenda::set_outputs_to_push_and_dup):

	Don't take specific inputs and outputs from md_data into account any
	longer to determine which WSVs are used inside an agenda. Since named
	parameters have been introduced to the controlfiles, all parameters are
	treated internally as generic inputs/outputs. A distinction between
	specific and generic is therefore not needed anymore and leads to
	unintended behaviour such as:

	NumericSet(lon, 0)
	NumericSet(lat, 0)
	NumericCreate(myg0)
	AgendaSet( g0_agenda ){
	  Ignore(lon)
	  Ignore(lat)
	  g0Earth(g0=myg0)
	}

	Before this fix, the above code would have run. Because g0Earth lists
	g0 as a specific output, the agenda engine wrongly assumed
	that not only myg0, but also g0 is actually produced. However, g0 is of
	course still uninitialized.  Now, the proper error that the agenda must
	generate g0 as an output is displayed. Bug reported by Patrick.

	Removed obsolete runtime error that an agenda input-only variable was
	used as output by a WSM. First, this is supported since some time now.
	Second, the error was only triggered if the WSV was used as an
	output before being used as an input variable. Bug reported by Patrick.

	WSVs that are input and output to a WSM were not correctly added to the
	agenda's internal inputs list.

	For AgendaExecute*, the inputs of the executed agenda were not
	correctly added to the internal inputs list of the calling agenda.

	(Agenda::is_input):

	Don't check specific inputs listed in md_data any longer for same
	reason as explained above.

	Also check for matches in WSVs that are input+output.

	Limit additional search for matches in generic inputs of type Agenda to
	methods AgendaExecute and AgendaExecuteExclusive.

	(Agenda::is_output):

	Don't check specific outputs listed in md_data any longer for same
	reason as explained above.

	If current method is AgendaExecute* check the output arguments of its
	agenda for matches.

	(Agenda::set_outputs_to_push_and_dup):

	Remove obsolete check that was triggered in some cases if a WSV that is
	defined as agenda input was used as an output variable by one of the
	WSMs in the agenda. This is works fine now.

	* src/m_agenda.cc (AgendaExecute), src/make_auto_md_cc.cc (main):

	Changed 'agenda checked' assertion to a runtime error. Otherwise
	the assertion can be triggered by user input using the WSM Touch and
	then executing the agenda.

	* src/workspace_ng.h (Workspace::depth):

	Add method that returns the scoping depth for a WSV.

	* src/m_general.cc (PrintWorkspace):

	Add scoping level to output for WSVs.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/agendas/TestAgendaExecute.arts:

	Modified g0_agenda to expose the bug that was fixed in this commit.

2017-01-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-602

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::skip_to_next_argument):

	Comment sign inside WSM call with named arguments was ignored if the
	comma was written on the next line. In the example below 'value' was
	parsed even though it's commented out:

	MatrixSet(out=m
	   #, value=[1,2,3]
	)

	Bug reported by Richard.

2017-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-601

	* src/montecarlo.cc (pha_mat_singleCalc):

	Found similar bug to previous commit. pnd_vec wasn't using the
	flattened index.

2017-01-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-600

	* Fixed serious bug, present if using several scattering elements
	together with (at least) MC or iyTransmission.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (opt_propCalc): pnd_vec was indexed with
	scattering element index only (i_se). That is, the indexing
	returned to zero when moving to next scattering element.

2017-01-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-599

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Added
	specular_losCalc to all agndes using the Lambertian method, as
	this is now required.

	* It is now allowed to have several reflections for one pencil
	beam calculation. That was unintentionally restricted. For
	example, you can now have a ppath that is reflected from one side
	of a valley to the other side. However, there is no limit on the
	number of reflections and you can possibly end up in an infinite
	loop. That biggest risk here is the Lambertian function. If this
	happens, try to use a smaller number of beams.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceLambertianSimple): Now takes
	surface_normal as input for safer handling of 2D and 3D. Added
	some notes about in the built-in doc.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Added ppath.np==1 in first if
	statement.

2017-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-598

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields):

	Throw runtime error if a species in scat_meta is empty. Otherwise an
	assertion failure is generated later on in the pnd_field* functions
	(e.g. pnd_fieldS2M). Besides that it doesn't make sense to have an
	empty species. Reported by Freddy.

2017-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-597

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):

	Fix check if scat_data_check_type is 'none' which always evaluated to
	true.

2017-01-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-596

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldZero): Now considers atmosphere_dim
	and checks that cloudbox_limits have the correct length. And now
	also handles 2D.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyIndependentBeamApproximation): Now picks up and
	passes on iy_id.

2017-01-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-595

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc): Missed to adopt the dummy
	declaration of the function.

2017-01-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-594

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	surface_skin_t now set, by extract from t_field.

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc): Now takes surface_skin_t as input.
	Replaces using t_field(0,0,0).

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceLambertianSimple): Removed the
	limitation to 1D. But 2D and 3D are only handled in a simplistic
	manner.

	(surface_scalar_reflectivityFromSurface_rmatrix): New WSM.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface_sub.arts: Removed
	unnecessary Ignore calls

	* src/workspace.cc: Small changes in doc of rtp_pos/los.

2017-01-18  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-593

	* Note: atmosphere_dim must be set before calling abs_lookupSetupBatch!

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupSetupBatch):

	Perform a full atmfields_checkedCalc() on the given
	batch_atm_fields_compact. This closes a loophole when only
	calculating a lookup table.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_lookupSetupBatch):

	Updated the documentation to include the performed atmfield check.

	The more sophisticated checks require atmosphere_dim as an additional input
	parameter for the method.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSU_MetMM_generic.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSU_generic.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/mhs/TestMHS_generic.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/mviri/TestMVIRI.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/seviri/TestSEVIRI.arts:

	Removed comments showing outdated abs_lookupSetupBatch syntax.

2017-01-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-592

	* src/m_oem.cc (inversion_iterate_agendaCall): Removed. This was a
	fix to the bug just removed.

	* src/m_surface.cc (FastemStandAlone): Frequency fix implemented here.

	* src/methods.cc: In all FASTEM methods, set 0.035 as default for
	salinity. Also for all versions, when calling the core fastem
	method, any frequency above 350 GHz is replaced with 350 GHz. This
	as Fastem gives unrealistic values from about 400 GHz. But as
	before, there is an error from Fastem if going above one 1 THz.

2017-01-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-591

	* src/m_agenda.cc (AgendaExecute):

	Copy inputs and outputs into new sets to sort them because
	set_difference does not work with unsorted arrays. Fixes bug in
	AgendaExecute reported by Patrick. Variables that are defined as input
	and output of an agenda were wrongly reset to their original value
	after AgendaExecute.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/agendas/TestAgendaExecute.arts:

	Add check for proper InOut scoping in AgendaExecute.

2017-01-16  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-590

	* src/m_general.cc, src/methods.cc:

	Renamed workspace method StringCompose to StringJoin.

2017-01-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-588

	* Added patch provided by Ian Adams <ian.adams@nrl.navy.mil>

	* MCRadar:

	An active radiative transfer model for radar that accounts for multiple
	scattering has been added. While in many ways based on MCGeneral,
	MCRadar uses forward Monte Carlo ray tracing to avoid difficulties
	with defining the transmitted polarization state inherent to reverse
	Monte Carlo methods. Numerical root finding is implemented to solve for
	path lengths involving horizontally-aligned hydrometeors. To accompany
	MCRadar, two workspace variables were created: mc_y_tx, which defines
	the transmit polarization, and mc_max_scatorder, which limits the
	scattering order to a prescribed degree (1 == single scattering).

	There are some differences with how MCRadar functions with respect to
	MCGeneral and yCloudRadar. MCRadar requires a finite (Gaussian) beam
	in order to receive energy from multple scattering events. Currently,
	MCRadar only limits integration by the number of photons, not by
	runtime or Monte Carlo error. Unlike yCloudRadar, MCRadar expects that
	range_bins will either contain round-trip times or distances from
	sensor, as altitude is meaningless for horizontal radar lines of sight.

	* Antenna Frame and Polarization Basis:

	The original implementation of the antenna pattern sampling used by
	MCGeneral did not rotate from the antenna frame into the frame used by
	ARTS. Instead, antenna zenith and azimuth angles were simply added to
	the boresight line of sight. Additionally, the antenna polarization
	basis was not defined, and sampling the antenna pattern resulted
	in polarization rotations that increased with increasing azimuthal
	distance from the boresight. The errors in both issues were greatest
	at nadir and zenith, with no impact for zenith angles of 90 degrees.
	To address these issues, a reference frame and polarization basis for
	the antenna boresight was created such that vertical polarization
	aligns with the plane created by the boresight los vector and the
	local zenith, i.e., defined by the azimuth angle, and the horizontal
	polarization is perpendicular to this plane. A rotation matrix is
	created using the boresight zenith and azimuth angles to rotate from
	the antenna frame to the local east-north-up (enu) frame, and the
	columns of the rotation matrix define the axes of the antenna reference
	frame in enu coordinates. Two randomly sampled angles are then taken in
	the v-k plane and the h-k plane, and converted to cartesian coordinates
	to define the sampled los direction in the antenna frame. The sampled
	los direction is rotated to the enu frame, and the corresponding v and
	h unit vectors are calculated. Antenna basis rotations are calculated
	using dot products of the boresight and sampled polarization unit
	vectors. The polarization bases follow Mishchenko's conventions,
	referenced to incoming radiation for MCGeneral and outgoing for
	MCRadar. Due to the polarization rotation, running MCGeneral or MCRadar
	with stokes_dim < 3 will result in loss of accuracy.

	* Bug Fixes:

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc, line 273 (before my changes): local_rte_pos was
	declared with a size of 2, but should have a size of 3.

	* src/m_ppath.cc, line 439: The azimuth angle is perturbed, but there
	was no check on whether the azimuth angle remains in bounds. Upper and
	lower limits are now checked.

	* Misc:

	When run in debug mode, MCRadar occasionally (~0.001%) trips the
	assertion check on line 540 of m_ppath.cc (in ppathFromRtePos2). The
	interpolation distance for the index of refraction terms is sometimes
	calculated to be < 6 microns larger than the ppath segment over which
	the interpolation is performed. This occurs in both nadir and off-nadir
	cases.

	* Changes applied after Ian's patch by committer:

	* src/mc_antenna.{h,cc}:

	Moved import of constants from header to cc-file.

2017-01-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-587

	* src/config_global.h: Removed, not needed anymore.

	* src/arts.h, src/libmicrohttpd/platform.h, src/matpack.h,

	Include config.h directly instead of global_config.h.

2017-01-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-586

	in fact just have one row (before additional rows were silently
	ignored).

	exactly as 2D and 3D. Added another GIN option.

	* src/workspace.cc: Polishing of description of iy_id.

	* src/rte.cc (apply_iy_unit, apply_iy_unit2): Inside these
	functions the name y_unit was still used.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard,iyCalc):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yCloudRadar): Changes related to iy_id.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Added iy_id as input to
	iy_surface_agenda and all iy_surface_sub_agenda-s.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed mblock_aa_grid. Should have been done earlier.

2017-01-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-580

	* make check-all works again. Not just fixed the problems, also

	* arts-2-3-579

	* Started on a feature to support storing data inside

	corresponding iy calculation. Not finished, got stuck with other
	things.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyIndependentColumnApproximation): Still in
	progress ...

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (pha_mat_sptFromData)
	(pha_mat_sptFromMonoData): Removed out3 printing just reflecting
	name of WSM.

	(scat_dataCheck): Commented out printing to out3 that drowned
	everything else.

2017-01-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

2016-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-574

	* Some restructuring of OEM. Not ready, mainly a "backup" commit.
	This commit brakes old cfiles including OEM. Either don't update
	or email me for info. Otherwise more later ...

	* src/m_oem.cc (x2artsStandard): x2arts_std renamed.

	(xaStandard): Internal function setup_xa now renamed and converted to WSM.

	(OEM): xa and initial x, jacobian and yf are now input, instead of
	being calculated internally. That is, these variables shall be
	prepared before calling OEM.

2016-12-17  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-573

	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Fix copy-paste mistake

	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{h,cc}:  Fix compilation warning for
	needless input.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns:  Added test for jacobian for
	line paramters.  This also serves to show how it is activated.

2016-12-15 Jakob Doerr  <jakobdoerr@googlemail.com>

	* arts-2-3-572

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITpressureoptimization.arts,

	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/yREFERENCE_DOITpressureoptimization.xml:
	
	Added files to test the pressure optimization in DOIT

	Added CMakeLists.txt to my previous commit

2016-12-13 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-571

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc):
	Bugfixed non-transformation check on azimuths (reported to yield odd
	consequences by PE in arts-2-3-569). Properly use ANGTOL_RAD (on angle
	in radians).

2016-12-13 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-570

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_dataCheck):
	Replaced check_type alternative 'none' by 'sane' (since it does not
	mean nothing is checked, but "only" sanity of K11,a1,Z11 is checked).

	* src/methods.cc (scat_dataCheck, cloudbox_checkedCalc, jacobianDoit):
	Adapted built-in doc according to above changes. Adapted jacobianDoit
	default setting of *check_type*.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatElementsToabs_speciesAdd):
	Update *check_type* setting in internal call of scat_dataCheck.

2016-12-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-569

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc): Changed check to catch cases
	where no transformations are needed. Now just considers theta.

	Discovered that MC calculations converged very very poorly.
	After testing different arts versions, found that the change of
	this if-statement was the point where MC started to behave poorly.
	Right now I don't know if the if-statement was wrong, or if the
	change made some bug in MC visible. Needs to be investigated, but
	made this change to resurrect MC to its old behaviour.

2016-12-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-568

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_dataCheck):

	Cleaner check for check_type argument. Must now be 'ALL' or 'NONE'.

	* src/mystring.h: New functions toupper and tolower for my_basic_string.

	* src/m_xml.{h,cc} (WriteXMLIndexed, ReadXMLIndexed),
	src/xml_io.cc (filename_xml_with_index):

	New argument digits that gives the desired width of the index. String
	of numbers with less digits will be padded with zeros.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit): Adapt calls to WriteXMLIndexed.

	* src/methods.cc:

	Add 'digits' argument to WriteXMLIndexed and ReadXMLIndexed.

	Update docs for scat_dataCheck.

	* src/m_linemixing.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLineMixedBands):

	Comment out parameter names in dummy function to avoid compiler
	warnings.

2016-11-25  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-567
	
	Update support for LBL catalog parameter derivations.  Now 
	with integrations over all levels
	
	* src/absorption.cc: Interface for pressure broadening partial 
	derivation updated
	
	* src/constants.cc: Updated naming scheme for derivatives seen
	by the user via methods
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}:  Added support for full integration via 
	a flag in RetrievalQuantity.  (diy_from_path_to_rgrids) returns
	only a vector if this flag is found.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc: (jacobianAddCatalogParameter{,s}) now no 
	longer accepts grids as arguements and instead activates the 
	integration flag.  Catalog parameters are constant at all points
	
	* src/m_rte.cc:  (iyEmissionStandard) Updated to integrate when 
	RetrievalQuantity says so
	
	* src/m_transmitter.cc: (iyTransmissionStandard) Mimics behavior 
	of iyEmissionStandard when asked to integrate (as far as possible)
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Updated comments for 
	jacobianAddCatalogParameter{,s}.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.{cc,h}:  Updated to calculate pressure 
	shift partial derivatives when available and also to return
	the exponent derivative for pressure shift.  There still
	remains an error in the central frequency calculations that I have 
	not managed to fix.  This affects both "Line Center" and all
	the "* Pressure Shift" partial derivatives and forms an error 
	that increases the further from the line center you are in 
	a symmetric manner, almost in an identical way for both these
	cases.  I am still looking at this...
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{cc,h}:  Added methods to calculate 
	the internal derivatives for pressure shift.  Also removed the 
	calculations for Planetary broadening as these were not working
	due to the rescaling.  Will have to think how do do that properly 
	at a later date
	
2016-11-24 Jakob Doerr <jakobdoerr@googlemail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-566

	* ChangeLog: Added version number to previous commit

	* src/m_doit.cc (OptimizeDoitPressureGrid): New method added to DOIT 
	that optimizes the pressure grid for every frequency seperately,
	based on the single scattering albedo and the scattering optical
	thickness and interpolates the fields to the new grid. The two
	corresponding thresholds, sgl_alb_max and tau_scat_max, can be
	set, but defaults are set. The maximum cloudbox size can be set by
	cloudbox_size_max. This method should be called inside
	doit_mono_agenda, right before doit_i_field_monoIterate. It can
	only be used if ScatSpeciesMerge has been called and if it is
	called, another method, doit_i_field_monoOptimizeReverse has to be 
	called right after doit_i_field_monoIterate to interpolate 
	doit_i_field mono back to the original size.

	* src/m_doit.cc	(doit_i_field_monoOptimizeReverse): New method that 
	interpolates the doit_i_field from the optimized calculation back
	to the original size. Should be called if OptimizeDoitPressureGrid has
	been called. Call should be inside doit_mono_agenda, right after 
	doit_i_field_monoIterate.

	* src/methods.cc: Defined OptimizeDoitPressureGrid and 
	doit_i_field_monoOptimizeReverse

	* src/workspace.cc (p_grid_opt): Defined p_grid_orig. It is used  
	in doit_i_field_monoOptimizeReverse and it stores the original 
	pressure grid.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Added pressure optimization test.
	
	Added pressure optimization test to the list (xml-data)	


2016-11-15 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-565

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4.arts:
	RT4 test case added.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Replace implementation test case TestRT4Test.arts by interface test case
	TestRT4.arts.

	* src/methods.cc (RT4Calc, RT4Init, DisortCalc):
	Added RT4 built-in doc. Default setup updated (Double Gauss with
	16 streams). Some polishing of DisortCalc doc.

	* src/rt4.cc (par_optpropCalc,sca_optpropCalc):
	Method summary corrected.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (pha_matCalc):
	Removed error-prone duplicate code for 1D and 3D (set up atm indices
	depending on atm_dim instead, then run the same calc loop regardless of
	atm_dim).

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/ampld.arts.f:
	Check input validity separately for each parameter and provide specific
	error message.

2016-11-09 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-564

	* doc/uguide/clouds.tex:
	Added scat_meta documentation.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc, methods.cc (TestScatDataInterp):
	Included full DOIT-like SSD extraction chain. Added & polished user
	options.

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc):
	Use tolerance in difference instead of equality for float-to-float
	comparisons. Added missing parts in interface documentation.

	* src/m_checked.cc (sensor_checkedCalc):
	For atm_dim=3 add lower limit check on sensor azimuth.

2016-11-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-563

	* This commit should fix all warnings in GCC 6.2 (except unused
	parameters in abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLineMixedBands and warnings in
	3rd party code).

	* src/complex.h: Fix indentation of return statements after for loops.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (special_matrix_exp_and_dmatrix_exp_dx_for_rt,
	matrix_exp_dmatrix_exp, matrix_exp_dmatrix_exp):

	Change type of r from Numeric to Index. floor() is used in the
	calculatoin of r and in all further uses, r is always compared to
	Index variables anyway.

	* src/linescaling.cc (partition_function):

	Fix indentation of break statement.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc):

	Fix indentation of checks.

	* src/m_radiation_field.cc (radiation_fieldCalcFromiyCalc):

	Reindent whole function because indentation was completely messed up.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseGenericAMSU):

	Change type of numPBpseudo and numPB from Vector to more appropriate
	ArrayOfIndex. Inserted explicit conversions to Numeric where needed.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_data_singleTmatrix):

	Change 0. to 0 in integer comparison.

	* src/m_xml.h (WriteXML): Reindent one line for better readability.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (gamma_func):

	Clean up implementation.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping, ppath_calc):

	Insert explicit type conversions to Numeric or Index where needed.

2016-11-08  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-562
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Turns out the abs() call was incorrect
	
2016-11-07 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-561

	* src/optproperties.cc, src/montecarlo.cc:
	Added coordinate system inconsistency warning at all places
	preparing/extracting single scattering data of PTYPE_GENERAL particles.

2016-11-07 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-560

	* Revision of scatterig media descriptions.

	* doc/uguide/clouds.tex, atmosphere.tex:
	Revision of scat_data and pnd_field documentation, extention towards
	internal calculation of both (not yet complete,	though).

	* doc/uguide/rte_theory.tex, doc/uguide/Figs/rte_theory/part_frame.pdf:
	Moved coordinate system description and figure from AUG to here.

	* doc/uguide/clouds_theory.tex, arts_theory.tex:
	Moved general size distribution descriptions here.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Updated zeeman paper reference.

	* doc/uguide/rte_basics.tex, symbol_defs.tex: Minor changes.

2016-11-07  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-559
	
	* src/{m_,}zeeman.cc:  Fix bugs introduced to speed things up
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{cc,h}:  Initial support for speed-dependent
	limit pressurebroadening in ARTSCAT5.  Still very much in testing.  Seems to
	work but it is not easy to find data/input.  Ask me if you have a use case.
	
	* src/rte.{h,cc}:  Fix for zero wind-fields.  Note that there is an abs()-
	call that might not be necessary.  There should be a normalization to -1/c,
	so the three components inside the switch needs to normalize to 1 and be
	positive
	
2016-11-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-558

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc): Replaced some asserts
	with a run_time error. Added also check of element (0,0).

	The idea to replace a few asserts with runtime error is to allow
	MC calculations to continue if these errors appear, and to give
	out an error message with information about what to do if an user
	stumbles upon these errors.

2016-11-06 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-557

	* src/m_optproperties.cc, methods.cc (TestScatDataInterp):
	Extented to emulate RT4 ssd extraction (not exactly te same though, as
	RT4 does not need individial inc/sca direction extraction and allow for
	in-place comparison of results. Allow user to control WSM behaviour a
	little more.

	* src/optproperties.cc (pha_mat_labCalc):
	Bug fix (delta azimtuh of 180 or 360 deg is forms great circle, not
	their sum). Effects random oriented particles only. Brings the MC/RT4
	like ssd extraction in TestScatDataInterp into agreement. Negligible
	effect on full RT solution, though.

2016-11-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-556

	* doc/uguide/arts_developer.tex, doc/uguide/arts_theory.tex,
	doc/uguide/arts_user.tex:

	Add UHH address for contributor list.

2016-11-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-555

	* montecarlo.cc (pha_mat_singleCalc):

	Fix indexing bug in inner loop over scattering elements. Caused a crash
	for cases that did not use ScatSpeciesMerge.

	* m_optproperties.cc (scat_dataCheck):

	Remove output of loop variables to out2. They create a huge amount of
	clutter in the output without giving any useful information.  They are
	still included in the error output if something goes wrong.

	Demote coefficients output from out2 to out3. This output was too
	detailed for out2.

2016-10-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-554

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): Path sampling now put inside a
	try block, to be somewhat more resistent against failures in the
	path sampling. Warning and error message are displayed at
	failures. The calculations are halted if there are 5 failures for
	one radiance calculation.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): Now waiting until 100000
	path points before issuing an error. The old value (25000) can be
	passed with tau limit and thick clouds.

	However, introduced a (hard-coded) limit of the step length.
	Presently set to 10 m. This to avoid pushing the ppath calculations
	too far, and avoid getting stuck if there is some extremly high
	extension values.

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2poslos): If za is >90 or <90 is now
	resolved by start za and comparing step length to distance to
	tangent point. Internal check to dr now gives a runtime error,
	instead of assert. This required some new input arguments.

	* src/ppath.h: Added declaration of geompath_l_at_r.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): Added an assert around
	ppc. Also, assert for icall is now icall < 10. Was already like
	this for 2D versions.

2016-10-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-553

	* src/m_surface.cc (specular_losCalc): Now throws a runtime error
	if the incoming direction corresponds to hit the surface from below.

	(surfaceSemiSpecularBy3beams): New WSM.

	(surfaceSplitSpecularTo3beams): Renamed from surfaceSplitSpecular
	and built-in doc written.

	* src/agendas.cc: Defined surface_rtprop_sub_agenda.

2016-10-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-552

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): Crashed if viewing
	direction was towards space. Now fixed. Or more in detail, now
	also handles cases where already start-up of ppath flags a
	radiative background.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (Sample_los):
	* src/montecarlo.cc (cloudy_rt_vars_at_gp): Some code replaced by
	instead calling mirror_los.

2016-10-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-551

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (TestScatDataInterp): So far just a test
	of a potential test.

2016-10-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-550

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsExtract1D): New WSM. More or less
	the reverse of AtmFieldsExpand1D.

2016-10-14 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-549

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ScatSpeciesMerge):
	As we change scat_data here, reset cloudbox_checked to 0 (unchecked).

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit):
	Adapting to change above, run cloudbox_checkedCalc after the Merge
	calls. Requires the WSM to carry a few more interface parameters.

	* src/methods.cc: Adapt to above changes.

	* src/make_array.h: Change to allow longer WSM parameter lists.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Add calls of cloudbox_checkedCalc after ScatSpeciesMerge.

2016-10-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-548

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): MC can now also handle cases
	where the surface_los have more than 1 angle.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceSplitSpecular): So far just an
	undocumented method used to test the new feature above.

2016-10-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-547

	* This commit introdcues a new MC feature!!! There is now an upper
	limit on the optical path for each step. Default value, in
	general.arts, is set to 0.1. All tests done so far indicated same
	or better results. We will do more tests and later send out an
	email. Please keep an eye on your MC results until then.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Earth.arts:
	Removed a setting of lambertian_nza as this old WSV is removed.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Added default for
	mc_taustep_limit. Set it to 0.1.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC): mc_taustep_limit is now input and passed on.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added mc_taustep_limit.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): taustep_limit is now an
	input argument.

2016-10-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-546

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): Made sure that
	background is set to undefined when recalculating ppath step.
	Needed when ppath step ends at the surface.

2016-10-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-545

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): My last commit made MC
	to crash for stokes_dim = 1. Mixed up 0 and 1-based indexing in
	one place!

2016-10-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-544

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): Code added that allows
	setting a limit on each path step in terms of optical thickness.
	Thsi feature is being tested. In this commit tau limit is
	hard-coded to 100, which maintains the old behaviour except for
	extreme situations.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Removed za_pos=0.5
	from definitions including surfaceLambertianSimple. This is anyhow
	default for the method. In addition, standard agenda definitions
	should use method default values, otherwise we have basically two
	different default settings.

	* src/methods.cc: For surfaceLambertianSimple, moved
	lambertian_nza from IN to GIN. The value 9 was selected as default.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed lambertian_nza as WSV. Semmed
	unnecessary to have such a specific variable as WSV.

2016-10-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-543

	* Some preperations to introduce an additional feature in MC:

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc):
	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc, ppathFromRtePos2, ppathStepByStep):

	Adopted to change below. That is, ppath_lmax has been added.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Added ppath_lmax as input
	to both ppath_agenda  and ppath_step_agenda, to allow algorithms
	to include modification of ppath_lmax.

2016-10-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-542

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_atmosphere.cc:

	(atm_fields_compactAddConstant): Add argument condensibles. When given,
	the added species' vmr is scaled by the vmr of the condensibles:
	VMR * (1 - VMR_sum_of_condensibles). Useful when the given VMR assumes
	dry air.

	(batch_atm_fields_compactAddConstant): Add argument condesibles and
	pass it on to atm_fields_compactAddConstant.

	(batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix): Remove extra fields from
	interface. They can be added with batch_atm_fields_compactAddConstant.

	* CHANGES-2.3: Add info about b_a_f_cFromArrayOfMatrix changes.

	* ChangeLog: Add version number to previous commit.

2016-09-29  Lukas Kluft  <lukas.kluft@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-541

	* controlfiles/classroom_exercises/exe3_jacobian/plot_jacobian.m:

	Removed second positional argument from round() call. It breaks backward
	compatibility with older MATLAB versions and 0 is the default anyway.

2016-09-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-540

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts:

	Reduce required accuracy in aligned particle reference comparison
	to 2e-10 to avoid failure if quad-precision is enabled.

2016-09-27 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-539

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldF07ML, pnd_fieldF07TR):
	Don't try m-D regression in case of monodispersions.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc),
	src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_dataCheck), src/methods.cc:
	Renamed keyword parameter determining what to check to
	scat_data_check_type and check_type, respectively.

2016-09-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-538

	* Fix bug in tmatrix quad-precision calculations. avg_tmatrix was using
	the parameter file from double precision.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/avg_tmatrixq.f:

	Added. Import parameters from amplq.par.f instead of ampld.par.f.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/CMakeLists.txt:

	For quad-precision use avg_tmatrixq.f.

2016-09-17 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-537

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc):
	Non-fortran build bugfix. Debug comments outcommented.

2016-09-17 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-537

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Calc,RT4Init):
	Tests showed that RT4 runtime is proportional to 3rd power of number of
	angles. That means, number of angles, including the quadrature streams
	plus any extra/user angles, should be kept as low as possible.
	Therefore, I disallow user-specified angles, ie no scat_za_grid usage.
	Instead, RT4Calc returns doit_i_field on the quadrature angles (number
	to be specified by the user) plus 0/180deg if not in quadrature angles
	already to satisfy ARTS' scat_za_grid requirements. Corresponding
	scat_za_grid is output of RT4. RT4Init (e.g. sizing of doit_i_field)
	adapted accordingly.

2016-09-16 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-536

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f:
	Bugfix in quadrature weights setting for extra-angles. Fixes
	i_field offset issue in calcs with (many) extra-angles.

	* src/doit.cc (doit_scat_fieldNormalize):
	Be slighty more verbose about actual applied norm_error_threshold.

2016-09-15 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-535

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Calc, RT4Init):
	Introduced usage of 'extra-angles' (ie. angles that are not
	computational streams). Work in progress.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f:
	Allow 'extra-angles' for all quadrature methods, not only Gauss-Legendre.
	Govern 'extra-angle'-use via specified number of extra angles instead of
	quad-type and zeroed mu_values.

	* src/m_doit.cc (DOAngularGridsSet):
	Allow N_za_grid=0. This for having a proper way to set scat_za_grid for
	RT4 with proprietary streams only.

	* src/m_doit.cc (DoitInit), src/m_disort.cc (DisortInit):
	Move check of scat_za_grid size further up for proper error in case of
	size=0 as introduced above.

	* src/m_rt4.cc, methods.cc (RT4Test), src/rt4.cc,h (rt4_test):
	De-hardcode location of test data.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/polradtran/TestRT4Test.arts:
	Better way to specify ref-output location.

2016-09-14 Alex Bobryshev <oleksandr.bobryshev@uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-534

	* controlfiles/instruments/avhrr/
	METOPA_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,
	NOAA15_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,
	NOAA16_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,
	NOAA17_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,
	NOAA18_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,
	NOAA19_AVHRR.backend_channel_response.xml,

	Changed the first and the last weights to zero. Before the first and
	the last weights were negative values. With negative values arts gave
	an error-message: backend_channel_response.data = [0, >0, >0, 0].
	
	* controlfiles/instruments/avhrr/TestAVHRR.arts:
	Add two agendas to controlfile:
	abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc
	Without these two agendas controlfile didnot work. Now the controlfile
	works without error-messages.

2016-09-13 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-533

	* src/disort.cc (phase_functionCalc):
	Apply a pnd threshold (<1part/galaxy) when deriving phase function from
	bulk scttering matrix. Obviously too tiny numbers cause numerical
	issues. Fixes issue reported by Patrick.

2016-09-08 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-532

	* m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxSetFullAtm):
	Bugfix: loop parameter for upper lat/lon edges corrected.

2016-09-08 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-531

	* src/m_disort.cc, m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc (cloudboxSetFullAtm):
	Moved the WSM definition (former cloudboxSetDisort) from m_disort to
	m_cloudbox. Extended applicability to any atm_dim.

	* src/constants.cc, m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Defined minimum distance between cloudbox and alt/lon edges as global
	constant (to hae them consistent in cloudboxSetFullAtm and
	cloudbox_checkedCalc. Adapted cloudbox_checkedCalc accordingly.

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Calc):
	FIXME note on up/down_rad to doit_i_field assignment using
	cloudbox_limits[0] (not an issues now, but needs revision when we allow
	cloudbox_limits[0]!=0).

2016-09-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-530

	* src/main.cc: Display relmat info with '-v'.

2016-09-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-529

	* src/m_rt4.cc (RT4Init):
	Loophole fix: RT4 has to be run with cloudbox_limits[0]==0.

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortInit):
	Minor modifications.

2016-09-05  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-528
	
	Non-working commit of relmat-arts interfacing.  Will work on
	this through to relmat and arts interface is clean.  
	Committing code to ease collaboration.

	* 3rdparty/relmat/*:  relmat and files to interfacce with it.
	See later commits for more details.
	
	* 3rdparty/CMakeLists.txt,CMakeLists.txt,config.h.cmake:
	*  src/CMakeLists.txt: ENABLE_RELMAT
	
	* src/linemixingdata.cc: Added LM_BYBAND as ignore tag for 
	band calculations.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}: Removed (ReadFromHitranModifiedStream)
	but added reading for hupper and glower to HITRAN reading.
	
	* src/linescaling.{cc,h}: Added (partition_function) as separate
	function to easier get partition function when other scale factors
	are not needed.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Changed completely adding 
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLineMixedBands) to interface with relmat.
	This is still very much work in progress where there will be more
	updates in the somewhat near-future  Currently, trying to use this 
	without changing the code will just result in throwing runtime_error.
	
	* src/jacobian.cc: Fix bug when vmr=0 gives jacobian as nan.
	
	* other files:  Only minor comments updae for problematic cases.


2016-09-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-527

	* doc/uguide/interpolation.tex: Small wording fix.

2016-09-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-526

	* src/methods.cc,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestClouds_Mars.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts: 
	Changed Z-norm threshold 0.01 -> 0.05 (such that the arts-xml-data
	scat_data passes and which should still be okayish. more detailed
	adjustments (what to do with norm deviations) are up to the individual
	scatt solvers. Reverted threshold-modifying settings in controlfiles.

	* src/m_disort.cc, methods.cc,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Renamed cloudboxSetDisort to cloudboxSetFullAtm (in line with renaming
	in ARTS2.2 for removing references to Disort there as well as with the
	fact that Disort interface does not require anymore whole-atm cloudbox).

2016-08-29 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-525

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_field*):
	Added check that produced dNdD vector contains any non-zero values (else all
	rescaling later won't help to reach the desired mass/number density/flux).
	Info/error message coding less error-prone through once per subroutine set
	psdname variable.

2016-08-28 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-524

	* src/methods.cc:
	Updated doc of *cloudbox_checkedCalc* and *scat_dataCheck*.

2016-08-28 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-523

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Added checks of scat_data: Freq coverage checks moved here. Checks of
	single scattering data validity (no NaN, no neg values in K11, Z11,
	a10) and Z norm. Except freq coverage, checks are performed by the
	WSM scat_dataCheck and can be switched off (idea: data, once created, is
	often re-used. then it's not necessary to check them at each new arts
	run. instead, a check can be done once using scat_dataCheck.).

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_dataCheck):
	Extended to also check for NaNs in single scattering data and for
	negative values in K11, Z11, and a11. Added Z norm check for
	horizontally aligned particles. Added keyword allowing Z norm checks to
	be skipped.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatElementsPndAndScatAdd, ScatSpeciesPndAndScatAdd,
	ScatSpeciesScatAndMetaRead):
	Removed freqency coverage check in WSMs that read scat_data/pnd_field
	for in-cloudbox use (where cloudbox_checkedCalc will be applied).

	* src/cloudbox.cc,h, xml_io_compound_types.cc:
	Remove passing scat data file names to chk functions and remove all
	references to files in output messages. Here, we only process data;
	files are - if at all, handled by the calling functions.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Adapted for WSM interface changes above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestClouds_Mars.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts:
	Increase sca_mat_threshold in cloudbox_checkedCalc to 5% in order to
	make these cases pass the now (semi-)mandatory Z norm test. We should
	actually review and improve the data...


2016-08-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-522

	* doc/uguide/clouds.tex:

	Small fix for aa-grid size of horizontally-aligned particles.

2016-08-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-521

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ScatSpeciesMerge):

	Extended merging to work not only for randomly oriented particles but
	all particle types. Weighted sum is now calculated for all dimensions
	of particle's ext_mat_dat, abs_vec_data and pha_mat_data.
	Horizontally-aligned case provided by Jana now shows numerically identical results with
	and without ScatSpeciesMerge.

2016-08-25 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-520

	* src/rt4.cc (sca_optpropCalc):
	Bug fix in azim. oriented particles branch: actually use particle's own
	azimuth grid in azimuthal integration, not the user-controlled one
	created for random orientation particles. Found by Oliver.

2016-08-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-519

	* src/doit.cc (doit_scat_fieldNormalize):

	* arts-2-3-518

	* src/montecarlo.cc (Sample_los):

	Made PFCT normalization check messages and thresholds consistent.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radtran4.f (RADTRANO):
	Increased max size of RT problem. More informative error output when
	allowed problem size is exceeded.

	* 3rdparty/polradtran/rt4/radscat4.f (CHECK_NORM):
	Outcomment PFCT normalization warning message. We leave that to ARTS.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts:

	ComplexVector and ComplexMatrix are implemented with similar 
	internal structures as Matrix and Vector.  The goal: to simplify
	calculations of relaxation matrix inversion.  Will also help
	with keeping function calls shorter by not having to copy
	complx numbers to separate vectors.
	
	Also, none of this code has been optimized and is probably slow.
	
	* src/blash.h:  Added references to zgemm and zgemv
	
	* src/lapack.h: Added references to zgeteri and zgetrf.
	Also added references to dgeev and zgeev.
	
	* src/complex.{cc,h}:  Implementation of ComplexVector and 
	ComplexMatrix copying Matrix and Vector.  This was done just
	by copy-pasting matpackI code and adding the word "Complex"
	where approapriate and changing most double/Numeric references
	to Complex.
	
	There is probably a lot of redundant code in here, and also 
	a lot missing.  Especially missing is ways to combine Vectors 
	and ComplexVectors in the same mult statements.  Should be 
	possible, could be useful, but when it is useful it should be
	possible to add and check these at the time of need.
	
	* src/lin_alg.{cc,h}:  inv function for ComplexMatrix is working
	by relying on Simon's implementation for Matrix.
	
	Also added diagonalize functions that return P and W from A in
	the statement diag(P^-1*A*P)-W == 0.  For both Complex and Numeric
	Also added secondary method to calculate the matrix exponent 
	using the diagonalizations for testing purposes.  (This 
	should be faster than the other method for smaller matrices
	but I think it is less numerically stable?  Not sure.  So for now only 
	available to ensure that the diagonalizations actually work for simple
	test cases.)
	
	Problem 1:  An eigenvalue/vector can be complex even if the original matrix
	is real.  I have not bothered taking this into account, but should 
	probably do so rather than work as presently returning the strange
	format used by lapack for these cases.  If this becomes used that is.
	By my tests, eigenvalues for the propagation matrix will be complex,
	so these cannot presently by calculated with this method.
	(I found somewhere that this is because propmat is the addition of an 
	hermitian and a skew-hermitian matrix, though somehow I cannot find that
	source again to confirm that my memory is not playing tricks on me...)
	
	Problem 2:  I am not using any test on the condition of the matrix, so
	nan and inf outputs are possible and probable if care is not taken.
	I could switch to the "x" versions of dgeev and zgeev, but I am unsure 
	on what else this will do.
	
	* src/matpackI.h: added diagonalize reference.
	
	* src/test*:  Added some tests of the functions above.

	* arts-2-3-489
	
	* src/quantum.h:  Changed from "Hund" to "Hund : Index".  Relying
	on Hudson to test if this works because it compiles locally, just
	as the last commit did?  If this fix does not work, then I will
	declare specific integers in quantum.h instead.

2016-05-20  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-488
	
	This update requires updating zeeman_constants.xml in arts-xml-data.
	Found bug in implementation for NO.  Should be fixed now following
	Berdyugina and Solanki's 2002 paper.
	
	Note:  This only works from a catalog that defines quantum numbers 
	that we can understand.  Reading HITRAN presently does not work for
	NO because the quantum numbers are not well-represented.  The 
	rules in the 2004 paper seems to not be work outside some limited
	frequnecy regions.  So this is disabled and you have to set
	the quantum numbers by hand if you use HITRAN.  (Or reenable it in 
	quantum_parser_hitran for testing if your freqeuncy region works as
	expected.  Just remember to disable this before committing any code
	updates...)
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Updated propmat_clearskyAddZeeman to just copy
	behavior of the preferable propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc,
	but slower by repetition.  Should probably deprecate this instead...
	
	Updated the other functions to remove a multitude of if-statements 
	and writing of quantum numbers directly to the Zeeman linerecords.
	
	* src/quantum.{cc,h}: Added a flag for hund case and a Lambda as 
	a quantum number.
	
	* src/rational.{cc,h}:  Updated handling of toIndex() for 
	half-integers.  2/2 failed before but is clearly an integer.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}:  Added the error handling of 
	isotopologue_quantum.  The change in zeeman_constants.xml
	showed me there was no error handling whatsoever other than
	"is it defined?".  Removed old frequnecy_change function
	handler for different Hund cases and moved this functionality
	in under one function that cares for the Hund-flag in the 
	linerecord.  
	
	Added an enum for the Auxilliary indexing so 
	that if this has to change again, it is easier.
	(I am thinking that visible lines having transitions away from
	the ground-state to the ground-state has to be treated differently,
	though I do not know how important this actually is...)
	
	Changed the quantum number handling so that the case a calculations
	can be made.  Also simplified the loop of J giving M.  Turns out that
	there was a bug in the stored data in zeeman_linerecord_precalc before,
	so that upper Ms where stored as lower Ms and vice versa, though there
	was another bug that also handled upper Ms as lower Ms and vice versa
	compensating for the first bug 1-to-1... it was a mess caused by the 
	J loop being too complicated for me.
	
	* doc/uguid/absorption.cc:  Changed to point at the precalc methods 
	rather than the old slower method for Zeeman.  Also updated its version
	of isotopologue_quantum.

	* arts-2-3-486

	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc):
	Revert critical region extension from 2-3-454. Can't reproduce the
	issues that led to the extension while the extension makes proper error
	catching more complicated.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Allow non-zero pnd at upper
	cloudbox limit if this coincides with top of atmosphere.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatSpeciesScatAndMetaRead):
	Added *.scat_data.xml/*.scat_meta.xml to allowed scat (meta) data naming
	patterns. This particularly since this is the default naming pattern
	when these data are created by ARTS WSMs.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (diameter_maxFromDiameter_volume_equ):
	Adapted to output consistent with current meta data format (different
	diameters). Removed tmatrix-specific error check (this method is not
	limited to tmatrix!).

	* src/methods.cc (diameter_maxFromDiameter_volume_equ): Doc adapted
	according to changes above.

	(scat_data_singleTmatrix): More comfortable default setup of
	data_aa_grid, which is irrelevant for randomly oriented particles.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.ssd.metaREFERENCE.xml:
	Adapted to changes above. 

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/prepare_metmm.arts:

	errors.

	(surfaceFastem): Remove inconsistent checks for salinity and wind_speed.
	These are passed on directly to FastemStandAlone and are checked there.

	* src/check_input.{cc,h}:

	Added three new variations of ckh_if_in_range (_exclude, _exclude_low,
	exclude_high) to be able to exclude the low, high or both values from
	the valid range if needed.

	Parts of this is still work in progress, parts are old promises, parts
	are me finding things that I have done apt for misunderstanding while
	looking through the code in preparation of my thesis.
	
	The work in progress will still experience great changes.
	
	* src/absorption.cc: Preparations for line mixing through relaxation 
	matrix. Check in xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper.  Work in progress.
	
	* src/lin_alg.cc:  (special_matrix_exp_and_dmatrix_exp_dx_for_rt)
	Made the parallel partial derivation executable in parallel whenever 
	not already in parallel.  
	
	* src/linemixingdata.h:  Preparation for line mixing through relaxation 
	matrix.  Setting up Band tags.   Work in progress.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:  Preparation for line mixing through relaxation 
	matrix.  ReadFromHitranModifiedStream perhaps temporary creation.
	(Paris group has a modified HITRAN format for some files.  This might
	get merged with main reading of HITRAN by some "if" statement 
	down-the-line.  For now separation is easier.)  Also, there was a
	backwards compatibility bug for ARTSCAT4 to 5 that is now corrected.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc: Removed lingering implementation comment.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  Tries to fix error reporting in species jacobian.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  Reading routine abs_lines_per_band in preparation
	for line mixing through relaxation matrix.  Very much work in progress.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc: Added a deprecated function that is called by anyone
	trying to access Voigt_Kuntz3/4 in accordance with old series of emails that 
	these are deprecated.  Also tried to clean-up the HTP line shape.  This entire
	code could be made so much simpler if we had ComplexVector as an ARTS class
	for Vectors containing "complex<Numeric>" instead of "Numeric".  (HTP 
	would now require 8 Vector outputs to handle partial derivation properly, which
	makes for a very annoying code so I have not made this implementation.  If
	xvector was a ComplexVector, then only two complex vectors would have to be returned
	to handle all partial derivations since d(F)/dx then could be 2xF-2/sqrt(pi), but 
	because of HTP complexity, two rather than one F must be returned for partial 
	derivations later on.  Anyways, I rant because I think it might matter in the future
	since Voigt data is incompatible with HTP data, so data published as HTP cannot be
	used in partial derivations if there is no fix in sight.)
	
	* src/m_linerecord.cc: Added method to "turn off" lines in abs_lines_per_species
	in preparation for line mixing through relaxation matrix.  To avoid duplicate lines.
	Work in progress.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.cc:  Added a comment warning about non-lte partial
	derivations.  While technically the code is correct there is a missing term
	in this implementation that could confuse people.  So commented a warning for
	anyone looking at the code in the future.
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Updated emission stepping for non-lte to make its design cleaner.
	Also removes four operations per frequency for hopefully slightly faster code 
	execution.
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.cc:  Updated HTP defaults to be in line with published
	works.  Made a mistake here before.
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Added two variables in preparation.  Work in progress.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Updated lineshape definitions.  I have Hartmann-Tran in there now 
	but there is still no way to get proper data to it since very limited publications
	have been made on it.  (So if you have data you want to use with this there is 
	still some minimal work required to input this data.  Since there is a temperature
	dependency issue still under discussion for the shape, different data sources 
	will still have different dependencies, so no general implementation is yet possible.)
	
	* controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/odinsmr.arts:  Now uses Voigt_Kuntz6.  This makes
	the file complain that it is not within 1e-2.  So I increased the error range.  I am
	hoping someone can confirm if this is still acceptable or possibly update y-reference?

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_oem.cc, src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Instead of removing the oem WSM completely if C++11 support is not
	available, replace it with a dummy function that output a runtime error
	to give the user information what he has to do to enable OEM. This
	makes OEM consistent with the behaviour of other optional features in
	ARTS.

	The actual function to calculate Matzler ref indices.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/refice/TestRefice.arts,
	TestRefice.complex_refr_indexREFERENCE.xml:
	For microwave use Matzler refindex data, not outdated Warren84. Set
	harder comparison threshold (old threshold was larger than imag refindex
	values as such; Warren84 passed as ok for Matzler reference data).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts:
	Replaced refindex model Warren84 by Matzler06 (in comment). Harden
	comparison threshold to the order magnitude of the actual ssd data (we
	don't want to test the t- and f-grid settings, but the data itself).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.aligned.ssdREFERENCE.xml,
	TestTMatrix.random.ssdREFERENCE.xml:
	Updated reference data according to changed refindex data.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (pha_mat_sptFromData, opt_prop_sptFromData):
	Added check that scat_data is indeed freq-dependent data, not scat_data_mono.

	modified line parameters of 183-GHz line. I also change the range of
	line stored in abs_lines_metmm.xml.gz to [0-1000e9 GHz]. Changed the
	reference file to correspond to the new changes.

2016-03-11 Simon Pfreundschuh  <simonpf@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-460

	Removed sstream.h file and dependencies. The file was included  as a
	guard for VERY old compilers not supporting the standard headers. However,
	since streambuf.h is not included in ARTS this cannot have worked, as far
	as I can see.

	* config.h.cmake:
	  Removed HAVE_SSTREAM macro.

	* src/iotraits.h:
	  Removed file.

	* src/sstream.h:

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (opt_prop_sptFromMonoData):
	Like the other methods, check T interpolation grid before trying to determine
	gridpos and interpweights, and give proper error message when fails. Found by
	Patrick.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc

	single T given.
	
	(opt_prop_sptFromData): Bugfix in derermining number of scatt elems per each
	species.

2016-03-09 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-456
	
	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc):

	versions).

	* arts-2-3-455
	
	* src/m_append.h:

	Allow appending a Matrix or a Vector to an empty Matrix. Feature
	requested by Jana.

2016-03-08 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-454
	
	Added temperature and scat angle grid interpolation of phase matrix for
	Disort data prep. So far this is experimental, hence implemented as additional
	option. So far previous state remains the default.
	
	* src/disort.cc, disort.h
	
	(phase_functionCalc2, pmomCalc2):
	These methods hold the altyernative phase matrix / phase function handling. 
	phase_functionCalc2 applies scat data interpolation methods developed for DOIT
	and consistent with extinction/absorption derivation methods applied by
	dtauc_ssalbCalc, namely spt_calc_agenda, opt_prop_part_agenda, and
	pha_mat_sptFromMonoData.
	
	(dtauc_ssalbCalc):
	Remove implicit assumption of cloudbox_limits[0]==0 (not a critical issue for
	now, where we disallow lower cloudbox limit anywhere else but at lowest atm
	level. but beter to avoid future confusions...).
	
	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc):
	Added T- & data_za_grid-interpolation option for phase matrix as alternative.
	Removed doit_i_field initialization, instead have it as input initialized by
	DisortInit. Extend thread-safe region (new phase matrix methods make changes
	to variables passed into disort, hence not only disort itself but also these
	modification parts need to be encapsulated.); later on try to reduce this
	region as far as possible. Moved data_za_grid identity check from DoitInit to
	here as this requirement depends on which phase matrix handling method is
	applied.
	
	* src/m_optproperties.cc
	
	(pha_mat_sptFromData):
	Bugfix. pha_mat_spt need to be flat scat elem indexed!
	
	(pha_mat_sptFromMonoData):
	Bugfix. Actually use pha_mat_data of different temperature grid points in
	transformation to lab coord system before temperature interpolation.

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_i_fieldSetClearsky):
	Check that cloudbox_on, else this does not need to be performed at all.
	Additional cosmetics.
	
	* src/methods.cc (DisortCalc, doit_i_fieldSetClearsky):
	Adapted to changes above.
	
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldCalcFromscat_speciesFields),
	src/optproperties.cc (pha_matTransform): Cosmetics.
	
	* 3rdparty/disort1.2/DISORT.f:
	Increased max number of computational levels, giving more room for refined
	vertical grids.

	* arts-2-3-453

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearskyAddFromLookup): Revision of
	extpolfac. This did not work at all. First of all, error checks
	did not consider extpolfac, the value of 0.5 was hard-coded. Doc
	was also wrong. Now extpolfac is applied for temperature and VMR.
	But decided to just allow standard extrapolation for pressure and
	frequency, to keep things a it safer.

	Hopefully I got it right and there are checks now for all
	interpolations (there was no check for frequency part), but
	please feel free to double-check.

	* src/m_linerecord.cc (abs_linesReplaceWithLines): Commented out
	error if replacement_lines is empty. That error check caused me
	problem as I have a general file with replacement lines, but in
	some cases I am just interested in lines inside some narrow
	frequency range having no "replacement". To allow a general script
	for this, I had to remove the error.

	Added. Disort-eqivalent to DoitInit.

	(DisortCalc):
	Adapted for possible calc of Disort-TOA non-iso incoming field and
	passing of cloudbox-only atm layer data to Disort. Removed a bunch of
	checks now performed by DisortInit as well as variables that were only
	needed for checks.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Updated DisortCalc doc. Added DisortInit.

	* src/disort.cc, disort.h

	Added. Method that calculates top-of-cloudbox incoming rad at DISORT stream
	and scat_za_grid angles, to be used as DISORT non-iso TOA rad.

	(planck2):
	Removed. When needed, physics_funcs.cc planck is applied (works now that f2c

	Work in progress: ARTS interface and DISORT code done. Data preparation within
	ARTS pending (regards calculation of angular grid, which needs to	correspond
	to DISORT's internal double-Gauss grid for the specified nstreams, and the
	incoming clearky rad at these angles (maybe we can use DoitGetIncoming for the
	latter?) as well as adaptation of DisortCalc to	flexible cloudbox sizes).
	
	* 3rdparty/disort1.2/DISORT.f:
	Added option of non-isotropic incoming radiation at TOA (code copied from
	modified DISORT version by Suzuki & Mendrok as used in and tested with
	SARTre).
	
	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc), src/disort_DISORT.h:
	Modified Fortran DISORT call interface for above feature.

	* arts-2-3-434
	
	* src/m_atmosphere.cc, methods.cc (AtmFieldsFromCompact):
	Introduce keyword that allows to remove low-pressure atmospheric levels from
	the atm field data (effectively moving TOA to higher pressure).
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	Apply the TOA move feature (has sufficiently small effects on radiance that no
	new reference data is necessary).

	3rdparty/tmatrix/lpq.f, 3rdparty/tmatrix/tmq.lp.f,
	3rdparty/tmatrix/tmq.par.f:

	Add tmatrix quadprecision sources.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add targets matrix_tmq and tmatrix_amplq to build quadprecision
	reference calculation executables.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/tmatrix_amplq.ref, 3rdparty/tmatrix/tmatrix_tmq.ref:

	Reference results.

2016-02-10 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-432
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	Complete and functional DISORT test case. Using a copy of
	doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts adapted to current DisortCalc
	restrictions as well as DOIT output as reference.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/indivfieldsatmo_setup.arts:
	Added. Separated case setup from calculation itself (when DisortCalc
	restrictions on	scatt element format is removed, remove this file, too, and
	use the original one from doit/ folder).
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/yREFERENCEfromDOIT.y.xml:
	Added. Reference results (from an equivalent DOIT calc).
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/scat_data_disort.xml:
	Removed. Was not used anymore anyways. Use sing scatt data from testdata/,
	commonly used by several scatt solver tests.
	
	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Switched on DISORT test as regular test case (fast; only if fortran enabled).
	
2016-02-09 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-431
	
	More bugfixing in DISORT related code. Now DisortCalc seems to work properly.
	
	* src/disort.cc
	(phase_functionCalc): Layer averaged (bulk) phase function from averaging of
	scat. coeff. weighted phase function (i.e. (bulk) scattering function), not
	plain averaging of phase function itself. Equivalently to layer optical depth
	and sing. scat. albedo provided by dtauc_ssalbCalc, output phase_function in
	DISORT-type layer oder (from TOA to BOA).
	
	(pmomCalc): Remove layer re-assignments of pmom as phase_fucntion is coming in
	in already correctly assigned order. This fixed an assignment mismatch for
	scattering-free layers.
	
	 * src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc):
	 Added assert in case of inconsistent pfct and ssalb (pfct can't be 0 when
	 ssalb is non-zero). Removed "Don't use this WSM" warning. Some code cleaning.
	 
	 * src/methods.cc: Updated DisortCalc disclaimer. Spellfixes.
	 
	 * 3rdparty/disort1.2/DISORT.f: Removed unsuppressable header printing (in
	 future govern this by ARTS verbosity level?).
	
2016-02-08  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-430
	
	Added along-beam-path flux calculations.  This is analytical
	but only for iyEmissionStandard.
	
	* src/constants.cc:  Added FLUX_MAINTAG.
	
	* src/jacobian.{h,cc}: (get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians) now 
	shows if flux_i is intended target by finding FLUX_MAINTAG in
	jacobian_quantities.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc: Added for_flux array of index.  This sets
	ppath distance to 1.0 for call to (get_diydx).
	
	* src/m_transmitter.cc:  Added fake_for_flux array of index.  If
	any is true this code throws a runtime_error.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}: (get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat) now takes for_flux.
	This sets dppath_ext_dx to negative ppath_ext, and 
	dppath_nlte_source_dx to zero.
	
	Also, (get_ppath_trans_and_dppath_trans_dx) now takes for_flux.
	This sets the derivative to not multiply by lstep (in the end);
	no changes were made to (ext2trans_and_ext2dtrans_dx) so here
	the derivative is divided by ppath.lstep[ip-1].
	
	* src/m{_jacobian,ethods}.cc: Added (jacobianAddBeamFlux).

2016-02-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/indivfieldsatmo_setup.arts:
	Undo accidential setup change (fixes check fail).
	
	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex:

2016-02-07 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-427
	
	Some bugfixes in data prep for DISORT calcs. Now nadir-view to BB surface
	difference to DOIT is below 1K. 50deg off-nadir still off by several K. :-/
	
	* src/disort.cc (dtauc_ssalbCalc):
	For tau don't only add up gas abs and particle ext, not particle abs. For
	scatt albedo do add gas abs to particle abs in denominator.
	
	* src/m_disort.cc, src/methods.cc (DisortCalc):
	De-hardcoded number of streams; now promoted to interface parameter. Throw
	error in case of uneven number of streams (else DISORT itself will). 
	
2016-02-06  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-426
	
	* src/zeeman.cc (set_magnetic_parameters):  Found case of |x|>1 in acos(x).
	The only way create |x|>1 was through numerical drifts. This means
	nan-output.  Set test to ensure |x|<1, which if broken gives eta=0 degrees.
	(Having x close to unity means theta is 90 degrees so eta cannot matter.)

2016-02-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-425
	
	* CMakeLists.txt, CHANGES-2.3, README:

	Don't enable NetCDF support by default. It's very limited and hardly
	used. Can be enabled if needed with a cmake option.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Only add NetCDF source files to artscore lib if enabled.

	* src/methods.cc: Don't mask % with \.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_data_singleTmatrix):

	Add two explicit casts to Numeric to avoid compiler warning.

2016-02-01 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-424
	
	Trying to make ARTS-DISORT work somewhat properly, closing a couple of traps
	and loopholes, fixing bugs.
	
	* src/m_disort.cc (DisortCalc):
	Replaced surface_emissivity_field with surface_scalar_reflectivity;
	lat/lon dependence wasn't used anyways, now allowing for frequency
	dependent surface reflectivity.
	Bit of restructuring code. Checks for only p20-type particles and
	identical scattering grids added. Both are implicitly assumed by the
	code, but weren't checked potentially causing significant errors. Angle
	grid size check added (see DOAngularGridsSet below), allowing only even
	numbers (DISORT can not really handle 90deg polar angles, so we should
	avoid them).
	Changed from using isotropic incoming rad at TOA to blackbody source
	cosmic background temp at TOA (both are possible. but setting TOA
	emisivity to 0 seemed dangerous as it potentially causes the TOA
	boundary to reflect. though that's not considered in the DISORT version
	we use so far).
	Bugfix in assigning DISORT output to doit_i_field levels.

	* src/disort.cc
	(phase_functionCalc): Calc scat coef only once for each atm level
	(DISORT handling only p20, i.e. scat coef independent of polar angle).
	Bugfix: loop over number of scatt elements of each species. This fixes
	the non-normalization complaints of pmomCalc.
	Moved pfct normalization with scat coef outside of sum-over-scatelements
	loops.
	Bugfix: layer-averaged pfct shouldn't become 0 when only one of the
	bounding levels' pfct is 0 (there are actually particles in this layer,
	which shouldn't be ignored!), hence take average in case of both given,
	take that one that's non-zero if only one is and only set 0 when both
	are zero. FIXME: this might have a corresponding unsuitable setting of
	layer single scatt albedo (and layer optical depth?) - dtauc_ssalbCalc
	check ToBeDone!

	(pmomCalc): Throw error if pfct normalization deviates more than 50%
	(than it's very likely a bug). Relax warning-level accuracy check of
	pfct normalization (with linear interpolation 1e-4 accuracy is only
	reached for Rayleigh particles), push warning back to out2 and
	renormalize pfct to 2.

	* 3rdparty/disort1.2/DISORT.f:
	Increased number of processable (output) polar angles 100->1000.
	Replaced Claudia's fix of planck emission within wavelength range for
	monochromatic case by separate monochromatic planck emission subroutine
	(PLK) using current ARTS constants (unfortunately, we can't use the C++
	ARTS settings directly, but have to use a copy here in FORTRAN code),
	fixing unit consistency issues.

	* 3rdparty/disort1.2/ErrPack.f:
	More verbose wrong-dimension statements: tell current dimension setting
	in addition to required one).

	* src/m_doit.cc
	(DOAngularGridsSet): Renamed from DoitAngularGridsSet since WSM is also
	used for creating DISORT output grid. Moved grid size checks from here
	into solver-specific methods since requirements are solver-specific.
	Allow single-element azimuth grid as this is not used/required for
	DISORT. Make empty za_opt_file the default.

	(DoitInit): Moved check of sufficient angular grid resolution for DOIT
	here.

	(doit_i_fieldSetFromPrecalc, doit_i_fieldSetClearsky):
	Added checks for doit_is_initialized.

	* src/workspace.cc:
	Removed surface_emissivity_DISORT. Spell fixes.
	
	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_data_singleTmatrix),
	src/tmatrix.cc (calcSingleScatteringDataProperties):
	Be more user-friendly: Introduced flag 'robust' for continuous calcs in
	case of individual fails and 'quiet' to switch on/off T-matrix' own
	screen output (e.g. for debugging). Defaults remains with quiet T-Matrix
	and failing all if anything fails. In any case, be more verbose on what
	failed.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/tmd.par.f:
	Increase NPN1 parameter, allowing more convergence iterations.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (MagRawRead, WindRawRead):
	Adapted convention on expected file names (adding 'mag_' and 'wind_' to
	allow for common basename for all atm data).

	* src/cloudbox.cc (chk_pndsum):
	Push back warning to out2, point out scat species concerned.

	* src/tmatrix.h, src/math_funcs.cc,
	Cosmetics.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Bit of alphabetic re-sorting. Expanded DisortCalc description. Adapt 
	DOAngularGridsSet description. Adapted interfaces according to changes
	above (DisortCalc, DOAngularGridsSet, doit_i_fieldSetFromPrecalc,
	doit_i_fieldSetClearsky, scat_data_singleTmatrix).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:
	More or less complete redo of test case, considering limitations of
	DISORT and its ARTS implementation (only use type 20 particles, all scat
	data given on identical angular grids, ...). Similar to
	doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts. Work in progress.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/doit_calc.arts, doit_setup.arts:
	Move iy_unit setting from doit_calc to doit_setup. Cosmetics.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts:'
	Moved setup into separate controlfile for re-use with other cases (e.g.
	consistent scatt solver comparisons).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/indivfieldsatmo_setup.arts:
	Added.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/DemoScat_DOIT_1D.arts:
	Adapted to WSM DOAngularGridsSet renaming.

	Replace identity comparisons of numerics with same-within-epsilon comparison.
	
	* src/check_input.cc, m_atmosphere.cc, m_tmatrix.cc:
	 Sorted include statements in header for better overview (assuming order
	 doesn't matter for functionality...).
	
2016-01-21 Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-420

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_data_singleTmatrix):
	Slight reorganiosation of code. Added check za_grid to fulfills tmatrix'
	equidistance requirement for randomly oriented particles. Set aa_grid as
	empty for randomly oriented particles.
	
	* src/tmatrix.cc (calcSingleScatteringDataProperties):
	Fixed ssd.abs_vec resizing bug.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts:
	Added randomly oriented particle test case.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.random.ssdREFERENCE.xml:

	Renamed from TestTMatrix.ssdREFERENCE.xml.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/ampld.arts.f:
	Spellfixes. Added ARTS (in addition to PyARTS) to header info.

2016-01-21  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-419
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Fix for workaround.  When voigt kuntz6 is the
	line shape, then phase must be zero or we can end up with 0*nan in
	a later calculations.  Bug found and reported by Lukas.
	Function affected: (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper)
	
	* src/jacobian.cc:  Added commentary on jacobian solver.
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Updated comments for species tags.

2016-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-418

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Add support for Intel Fortran.

	Ignore warning 1682 with Intel C++ compiler.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt, controlfiles/artscomponents/fastem,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/refice:

	Add simple fastem and refice test cases. Main purpose is to ensure the
	Fortran interface is working as expected.

	Note on refice (Warren84): While fastem and tmatrix results are
	basically identical between gfortran and Intel compiler, strangely the
	refice code gives a difference of ~0.04 for the real part (value is
	around 1.8) in this test case. This needs further investigation because
	at this point it is not clear which compiler is better or worse.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTmatrix.arts:

	Read reference refractive index from file for consistency check of
	tmatrix output.

	Compare SingleScatteringData against reference file.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (complex_refr_indexIceWarren84):

	Disable OpenMP in loop (for now) to resolve segfault with Intel Fortran.

	* src/parameters.cc (get_parameters):

	Don't crash if an empty "" commandline argument is passed to arts. Fixes
	bug reported by Lukas.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_basic_types.cc:

	Add Compare functions for SingleScatteringData and Tensor5.

2016-01-20  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-417

	* src/tmatrix.cc: Removed all wavelength related unit conversions before
	and after tmatrix fortran code calls as well as all references to microns
	units. Mishchenko's tmatrix code does NOT require size and/or wavelength
	in microns, just consistent units of both (i.e., ARTS convention of
	SI unit m for both is fine).
	
	* src/m_tmatrix.cc:
	Removed m->um conversion when calling calcSingleScatteringDataProperties.
	Spell fixes: ngds->ndgs, meat->meta.

	* src/methods.cc (scat_data_singleTmatrix):
	Renamed ngds to ndgs for consistency with original tmatrix. Added
	explicit unit info for diameter_volume_equ input parameter.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/ampld.arts.f: Formatting fixed.

	* arts-2-3-416

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatSpeciesExtendTemperature):
	Skip extending when only one T_grid point given.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	Examplary apply SSD T-extension for cloud ice (actually doesn't have any
	affect here as extension is actually skipped due to single T_grid point
	in input SSD; but still okayish for demonstrating usage. in future would
	be better to have T-dependent data applied here.). 

	* src/methods.cc (ScatSpeciesExtendTemperature):
	Documentation added.

2016-01-18  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-415

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc:
	Added WSM ScatSpeciesExtendTemperature to extend single scattering data

2016-01-18  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-414
	
	* src/m_jacobians.cc,methods.cc:  Fix for big bug I introduced
	unwittingly.  I had mistakenly assumed that (jacobianAddAbsSpecies) 
	was to calculate atmospheric species and not species tags.
	Now, the method takes the input parameter for_species_tag to work 
	on species tags as in the past.  When this evaluates true,
	the old behavior is returned.  When it evaluates true, then
	new behavior of looking for atmospheric species takes effect.
	
	* src/jacobian.cc:  Fix check and throws error when appropriate in
	(get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians).
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc:  (abs_speciesAdd2) called jacobianAddAbsSpecies
	manually.  So it calls it with default behavior as before,
	for_species_tag=1.

	(triangular_solve_matrix):

	Avoid compiler warning by not shadowing a local variable with another.

	* 3rdparty/Eigen/src/SparseCore/AmbiVector.h,

	Add explicit casts to size_t and Index to avoid implicit type
	conversion warnings.

	* 3rdparty/Eigen/src/SparseCore/SparseView.h (SparseView::SparseView):

	Fix compiler warnings by not shadowing member variables with function

	Consolidation of jacobian work.  Old analytical methods no longer
	available in clearsky calculations.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:  Added
	unphysical transmission test to this file.  Just so the code
	gets activated.
	
	* doc/uguide/references.bib:  Added a reference to the matrix
	derivation that is in use by the jacobian calculations.
	
	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex:  Changed text to reflect changes in
	jacobian.  Comments appreciated here.  Still do not know what
	level to put discussions in user guide.  For instance, now I
	refer to the theory guide for several expressions.  Expecially,
	the temperature subsection and non-LTE should probably be 
	improved.  It is difficult to just add non-LTE to the text...
	
	* src/{absorption.h,lineshapes,cc}:  Name change to fit text 
	better.  Only one variable.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  Removed "from propmat" as an option.  This
	is now the new "analytical".  Old analytical no longer possible

	* src/m_transmitter.cc:  Changed to transmission2 as default.
	Old transmission removed.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): Adopted to change below.

	* src/workspace.cc: Changed definition of mc_source_domain. The
	variable now includes an distinction between gas and particle

	can be determined. This resulted in that a different order felt
	more natural, withboundaries first. Surface was before last [2],

2015-12-10  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-382
	
	* src/rte.cc:  Did some code review and I found that polarized NLTE
	was treated inconsistently between (emission_rtstep) and the 
	jacobian calculations.  It was assumed that the source term is 
	unpolarized, solving this expression for polarized terms:
	"iy(iv,i) = tt[i] - t(iv,i,0) * ( bbar[iv] + J_n[i] );"
	but if J_n is polarized, the correct expression should be
	"iy(iv,i) = tt[i] + tmp(i,0) * bbar[iv] + J_bar[i];",
	with id_mat(tmp); tmp-=t(iv,joker,joker); and 
	mult(J_bar, tmp, J_n);
	
	This is now changed in (emission_rtstep).

	For iyEmissionStandard only now...
	Made a function (get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat) that replaces the 
	combination of get_ppath_pmat, the wind correction and the
	transmission matrix calculations.  It also takes over 
	calculations of partial derivatives from iyEmissionStandard.
	This applies not only to the partial derivatives of type
	"from propmat" but also to "analytical" partial derivatives.
	Patrick, I need you to check that I am not messing something
	up here.  In particular regarding cases where the parameter
	is perturbed might behave strange in an unintended manner.
	
	This all results in small changes in the behaviour of "analytical"
	for fully polarized signals (order of magnitude, the change is on
	a level of 1e-5 in my simple tests.).  The tests in wfun still
	works.
	
	* src/jacobian.cc:  Changed an error call because it helped me
	debug.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc:  get_ppath_pmat and tmat calculations replaced
	by single function call.  Removed all calculations of shifted
	propagation matrices.  One problem remains:  temperature 
	derivative of the blackbody radiation is still calculated as 
	before.  I think this should be made part of the call to
	(get_ppath_blackrad) so we can use pure analytical derivatives.
	
	The Jacobian calculations are now done on the percalculated 
	internal partial derivatives instead of estimating the internal 
	partial derivative in the code blocks.  In essence, this means that
	the expressions for the fields and for species absorption should 
	be identical, so this should perhaps change to make the code cleaner.
	Temperature still need some more treatment due to blackbody partial
	derivative with temperature.  (Wind as well, due to blackbody 
	frequency partial derivatives, but we did not care for that so 
	far.)  This should perhaps be treated as an "extra" for temperature
	as I treat NLTE in the Jacobian parts?
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}:  Commented some code away since it just wasted cycles.
	(ext2trans_and_ext2dtrans_dx)
	
	In (get_ppath_pmat), I forgot to test if there is nlte in the nlte
	partial derivative calculations...
	
	Added (get_ppath_pmat_and_tmat) as pretty much the same as
	(get_ppath_pmat) but connecting more parts together.
	
	(get_ppath_trans_and_dppath_trans_dx)  No longer has to act on
	ppd since dppath_ext_dx should be full now.  Might introduce problems 
	with "perturbation" calculations...

	* arts-2-3-375
	
	Added NLTE temperatures to Jacobian calculations.  Will just throw
	an error for now.  This is fixed when we have moved some or most
	of the jacobian calculations away from iy* functions.  (The code
	in m_rte.cc is there so we do not miss something in the future.
	The code has not been thouroughly tested and is not expected to
	work without some more changes.  For instance, Wind does not work
	now since frequency derivative of the Planck function is never 
	multiplied with the wind/frequency derivative.)
	
	* rte.{cc,h}:  Now returns dppath_nlte_source_dx from get_ppath_pmat.
	This serves as the derivative with regards to any parameter for Jn 
	in iy = t*iy + (1-t)* ( B + inv(extbar)*Jn ) from emission_rtstep.
	
	* src/m_{cloudradar,fos,transmitter}.cc:  Gets dummy nlte variable.
	
	* src/{partial_derivatives.{cc,h},constants.cc}:  Set NLTE_MAINTAG
	and fixed some keywording.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  Added jacobianAddNLTETemperature.  Will fail
	in m_rte.cc due to now allowing NLTE in calculations with jacobian
	yet.
	
	* m_rte.cc:  Changes in iyEmissionStandard.  sibi variable now 
	calculated with nlte effects considered.  sibi is the term
	that is multiplied with dt/dx, which means -inv(extbar)*Jn 
	following emission_rtstep.  Also in each of the different
	jacobian calculations, the same term of 
	T0 (1-t) d/dx(inv(extbar)*Jn) is added, where T0 is the cumulative
	transmission to that point.  That is with this equation
	d/dx(inv(extbar)*Jn)=inv(extbar)(dJn/dx-dextbar/dx inv(extbar)Jn)
	[note that order matters for matrix multiplications].  The 
	implementation should be identical to the implementation for the 
	B-term as has been done for temperature jacobian since before.
	I have to add this term to all jacobians since source is a 
	function of more inputs under NLTE.

	For a simple usecase define and laod from xml a QI such as
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<arts format="ascii" version="1">
	<QuantumIdentifier>
	O2-66 TR UP J 9/1 N 9/1 LO J 10/1 N 9/1
	</QuantumIdentifier>
	</arts>
	Then calling abs_linesChangeParameterForMatchingLines(QI=QI,
	parameter_name="Central Frequency",change=20e3) will change
	the O2-66 9+ line frequency by 20 kHz.  Warning: If v1=1 
	line is part of the catalog, then this matching will fail since
	it is only a partial match.  Setting "loose_matching=1" will
	succeed, but both v1=0 and v1=1 lines will have their frequency
	changed in the example above.  Other "parameter_name" are 
	available as per online documentation.  Also, if a relative
	rather than absolute change is needed, set "relative=1" in
	the function argument.  The parameter then changes by a 
	factor (1+change).

	These are the last of the semi-analytical expressions that can now
	be found from partial derivation of the propagation matrix.
	
	* src/{jacobian,m_rte}.cc:  Fixed bugs in magnetic field jacobian.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  Activated from_propmat magnetic jacobians in
	(jacobianAddMagField).  For now, perturbations are used on u, v and w
	components.  They are very complicated to get right analytically, so
	some more thinking is needed.
	
	I also add analytical expressions for strength, theta, and eta 
	components jacobians.  (I tested it and found that squared strength-jacobian
	mostly of agrees with summed and squared u, v and w jacobians.)
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Changed so magnetic jacobians take some inputs.
	
	* src/zeeman.cc:  Changed to perturb for u, v and w magnetic jacobians.

	Added support for line catalog parameter partial derivatives in "from propmat".
	Added parameters are: reference line strength and several types of pressure
	broadening parameters.  These can be activated using 
	(jacobianAddCatalogParameter).  I am trying to be generous in throwing my errors
	when the user tries to activate this for unsupported cases.  Note that using a 
	non-catalog calculation (e.g., lookup table or continua), results in 
	a warning presently.  I am wondering if this should instead result in a zero
	term instead?  We cannot know if a line is in continuum or lookup as far as I am
	aware.
	
	Some growing concerns:  The code is generously wasteful right now.  The 
	PropmatPartialsData class is created many times despite being identical each time,
	and some design decisions I have made could be improved significantly by moving
	some loops and identifications of partial derivative properties outside of
	these loops.  I would be happy to have some comments on this.  
	
	* src/absorption.cc: Added very bulky interface to internal line parameter
	derivatives.  This presently wastes a lot of computing cycles.  I need a more
	consistent way of always knowing if a line needs some calculations or not.
	
	* src/constants.cc:  Following other parameters, I implemented some text strings as
	constants for identifying if a term is understandable or not.
	
	* src/jacobian.h:  Finally needing the QuantumIdentifier's, I renamed their interface
	for clearer reading.
	
	* src/{m_jacobian.cc,methods.cc}:  Added (jacobianAddCatalogParameter).  Most 
	tests should be clear.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc:  Added interface for knowing that a parameter is another jacobian
	to iyEmissionStandard.  This is a temporary solution as we plan to move a lot of 
	this code soon.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.{cc,h}:  Added more inputs to the partial_derivatives 
	functions.  This is getting input-heavy.  Also added tracking system for 
	catalog parameters.
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{cc,h}:  Added one function per output derivative of
	interest.  This right now means that each pressure broadening scheme might require
	upwards to eight functions for the various outputs.  But not all.  I have gone 
	with throwing errors generously for now.  For instance, Artscat-4 broadening
	just says that foreign broadening is not a thing in Artscat-4, and it has no
	replacement for foreign broadening.  The same is true for water broadening and 
	the Artscat-3 scheme.
	
	* src/quantum.h:  Added (operator==) for two quantum identifiers.  Needed to ensure
	that we do not duplicate too many things in the (jacobianAddCatalogParameter).
	I might think of using it for line matching later on but I need some thinking on 
	this first. (E.g., how should we enforce isoptopes being defined in the catalog 
	matching?)
	
	* src/zeeman.cc:  Fixed typo.

2015-10-28  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-354
	
	Added support for "from propmat" for wind.  Note that relative errors
	of orders of magnitude between this method and "analytical" occurs at
	frequency ranges of small partial derivative values.  I think this is
	an error in the "analytical" approach, since exactness of frequency is
	really important for these small values.  Looking in details of the
	plots, when the partial derivative is increasing, the "analytical"
	method shows slightly lower values than "from propmat", and when
	the partial derivative is decreasing in value, the "analytical" method
	shows slightly larger values than "from propmat".  This is an effect
	expected for numerical derivatives.  Also, this shift is why orders of 
	magntiude large relative errors occurs.  At the zero-crossing, it is
	such that when one of the methods show a zero-value, the other is 
	much larger/smaller.
	
	That said, I think the differences between methods are negligble when it 
	comes to inversions.  The relative errors are only large for frequency
	ranges where sensitivity to wind is anyways practically zero, so
	there is no information avalable anyways.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:  Added error checking 
	for wind.
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}: Fixed bug.  Preliminary adding
	of absolute wind speed to potential wind jacobians.
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  (jacobianAddWind)  This function now takes 
	two additional arguments: "method" and "dfrequency".  It sets the runs
	behavior according the these inputs.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc: (iyEmissionStandard)  Calculates the frequency to wind 
	derivate ratio.  This is done since the f_grid seen by propmat is already
	altered by wind so internally, in propmat calulations, only the frequency 
	derivative can be calculated.  (Right now, there is no optimization for 
	this so if several wind parameters are wanted, then several frequency
	derivatives are calculated, wasting cycles.)
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Changed (jacobianAddWind) as above.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.h: Small changes in internal checks which failed 
	before when mixing different methods to create one jacobian.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}:  Added dotprod_with_los_dWd{u,v,w} functions.
	
	* src/zeeman.cc:  Fix bug where I did not support VMR calculations for 
	Zeeman species.

	Fix so that Zeeman temperature derivatives work with "from propmat".
	There was a very small bug in indexing.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.cc:  Changed sign to remove rather than
	add the phase lineshape derivatives.  This is from the notion that
	w(z=x+iy)=F=Fa+iFb, and multiplying things with iy results in negative
	values.  I am very much unsure where the true minus sign is supposed
	to be, here or in the lineshape, so that the physically correct number

	Now I consider the internal partial derivatives of temperature in working
	condition.  At least for some uses.  There can always be more bugs.
	
	Note that the test in TestWfuns still fails at 3.6105e-05 in the
	comparison as it stands.  I am not sure why.  I suspect there could be some
	error lingering for high altitudes.  I get 4% differences between my own
	perturbations and partial derivatives on the line shape when pressure
	is low (below 1 Pa) at frequencies around sigma from a line.  
	This is of course also where we expect there to be differences if 
	there are any, so now I am unsure if there still is a coding error or not.
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt:  Added test for some of the internal partial derivatives.
	I will likely expand this test in the future when more problems occur.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  (GetLineScalingData_dT) Now outputs the derivative of the
	stimulated emission.  Before, this caused relative errors of 1e24 (... from
	a small value, but it was significant for the results by about 10% of the output
	missing).
	
	* src/linescaling.cc:  (GetLineScalingData_dT) changed as above.  Also, dQ/dT is
	now a pseudo output of dQ/dT * 1/Q.  This is a design decision I make quite frequently, 
	since it lowers number of operations.  Should perhaps fix this to either be a consistent
	"always" or "never".  The advantage of doing this is that I need to multiply dQ/dT with
	the scaled lineshape at some point, and this scaled lineshape already incorporates Q,
	whereas I need the value for dQ/dT instead of this Q.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Fixed bug included in last code-push.  The minus sign change
	was completely wrong and just compensated for the error with the stimulated
	emission.
	
	* src/test_propmat_partials.cc:  Added some tests for T-derivatives.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Added check for line shape having partials.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Changed lineshape_voigt_kuntz6 to give back numerical partial
	derivatives.  I used this in TestWfuns and the changes makes this function agree
	with faddeeva_algorithm_916 line shape and partial derivatives.  Note that for 
	partial derivative calculations, faddeeva_algorithm_916 will be faster since it is
	only looping frequency once to get partial derivative and lineshape_voigt_kuntz6
	is looping frequency three times (recursive calls with perturbed variables).
	
	Also changed the helper functions so that both faddeeva_algorithm_916 and 
	lineshape_voigt_kuntz6 get internal partial derivatives from the same source.
	They both operate on the same principle, so this should be OK.
	
	Note that the temperature partial derivatives are still different between the
	"analytical" and "from propmat" cases, and that I still do not know why.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.cc:  Discovered a bug in the temperature part of the code 
	(which did not affect the end results for the previous commit but made the new 
	code act strange).

	* src/absorption.cc:  Renamed some internal variables for easier reading.
	
	* src/linescaling.cc:  Added comment on partial partition function design.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Added comment and changed signs.  The signs here are difficult
	to get right.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Another bug in the continua derivatives fixed.  With this and the above
	general shape is similar between wfuns when using on-the-fly calculations.  Differences
	still remains...
	
	* src/m_cia.cc:  In fixing to not output pseudo cross-section I also removed adding the 
	cross-section when the secondary and first species are not the same.  This is now back.

	VMR with "from propmat" and "analytical" now works idtentical for both lookup
	and on-the fly in Wfun test.  Temperature still has issues in this test for 
	on-the-fly.  Its shape looks OK but some values are way too large.  I repeat,
	there are plenty of variables in the temperature partial derivative so I will
	have to go through these to find if something might be wrong...
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Reformat of wrapper function to allow calculations
	even without phase functions if some jacobian quantitites are specified.
	
	Still remains to allow calculations with more lineshapes...
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Moved VMR partial derivatives from xsec to coef.
	Previous version did not return dxsec_dx, but some hybrid that worked
	once in coef.
	
	Fixed continua bug whereby if internal partial derivatives were 
	calculated for more than one continua, then all failed...
	
	With this fix, VMR "from propmat" or "analytical" are identical
	lest we count that CIA is also doing vmr for secondary species.
	NOTE:  The correct VMR partial derivative have to take change in
	pressure broadening into account but this has not been done in the
	code.  That was also ignored before.  I am wondering whether a
	"fast" and "full" option should be made available at some points...
	
	* src/m_cia.cc:  Fixed so no psuedo partial derivative is returned.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc:  Changed interface to look more alike between VMR and
	temperature.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  Had to add test here to allow no phase in
	absorption.cc for special cases.  I am strongly considering dropping
	support for the non-PreCalc option for calculations of Zeeman effect.
	It is slower and needs more special treatments than its cousin.  To no
	known gains.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.cc:  Removed VMR calculations since these
	gave psudo xsec partial derivatives.  Started debuggin and changing
	temperature derivatives.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.h:  Added one test and refined another.
	Added knowledge about species to all parameters, so that a flag can
	be used when there is no species.

2015-10-07  Richard Larsson   <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	WARNING:  This breaks your controlfiles.  propmat_clearsky_agenda and 
	abs_xsec_agenda now both depends on jacobian_quantities, so it has to
	be initialized.  I believe that there must be some bugs in the code at 
	present, but it is very complicated so I need some tests that are general
	enough, which is why I submit the code as is.  There are many terms 
	involved in the temperature partial derivatives.
	
	The new feature is the calculations of partial derivatives within the 
	absorption scheme.  This partial derivative scheme interfaces with the
	Jacobian calculations in iyEmissionStandard.  Presently, only Temperature
	and VMR works, and it can be activated by changing the Jacobian method to 
	"from propmat".  The code is in place to allow for all of the present
	schemes but this remains to be tested before becoming activated.  So the 
	descriptions below will also deal with other parameters.  There are some 
	limitations: e.g., that VMR is the only allowed setting for Abs Species.
	
	Once this has been tested and seems to work I will update the documentation 
	with the additions.
	
	Note that some numbers are presently perturbed (e.g., tabulated CIA values).
	This might be changed in the future by interpolating the partial
	derivative.  Please view this initial release as Testing, and report 
	bugs/missing features/incompatible  behavior to me directly so these 
	can be sorted.  The intention is to be backwards compatible but not 
	wastefully so.  E.g., VMR is the only way to calculate Abs Species 
	presently (though it might be possible to do so in more ways.)
	
	About speed:  The code is about as fast as before in performing the tests,
	at least in Release mode.  I suspect it might be much slower under Debug 
	mode.  Using "from propmat" instead of "analytical" makes a yCalc call
	in average 10% faster.  I suspect the increase in speed is much more
	noticeable if calculating other fields than temperature, since this is
	by far the most complicated of the lot.
	
	* src/ CMakeLists.txt:  Added partial_derivatives.{cc,h} for internal 
	calculations and an internal tracking class.  This is likely where most 
	of the bugs and mistakes are located.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  (xsec_single_line) now outputs partial 
	derivatives of the line absorption.  So that these are added at
	the right place when given cutoff, the cutoff range is also output.
	Since this change facilitated several internal loops, I simplified
	the code by manually looping over frequnecy rather than using built-in
	features.  All other behavior remains as before.
	
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) now also acts as a wrapper for 
	partial calculations.  Name change?  Not yet but soon a must.
	The reason is that partials also require the line shape to output
	phase, or at least be able to calculate it internally.  Presently,
	all internal partials are calculated separately from the internal
	value.  I think it would be speedier to do more things on-the-fly,
	so perhaps this will change later.  The bulk of internal partials
	are calculated after the calls to (xsec_single_line).
	
	Old functions:  I outright removed unused code for old xsec_species, since
	this caused headaches with other changes.
	
	In header file, I changed the definition of line shape and line normalizations.
	Normalization functions all now also can return their internal partial 
	derivativeis with respect to temperature, frequency and line frequnecy.
	There are two options for lineshapes:  either they return partials and 
	support deturning internal partial derivatives for temperature, frequency,
	gamma, magnetic field strength, and line mixing frqeuency shift.  More could
	be added, but I did not bother for now.  The other option is that the line 
	shape do not support partials.  Warnings should be thrown when you muck 
	about with this and make a mistake.
	
	* src/agendas.cc:  Added dpropmat_clearsky_dx, dnlte_dx_source, 
	and nlte_dsource_dx as inputs to propmat_clearsky_agenda. 
	Note that two of these remains unused.  Also added jacobian_quantities 
	as required input to allow methods to not do wasted calculations by 
	setting this array to size zero.  Similar changes are applied
	to abs_xsec_agenda, but only one NLTE parials output is given,
	since the other is from Planck function derivative.  The workspace
	variables are called dabs_xsec_per_species_dx and 
	dsrc_xsec_per_species_dx, though they are not "per_species".  
	Name change?
	
	* src/{methods,workspace}.cc:  Plumbing for other changes.
	
	* src/constants.cc:  PROPMAT_SUBSUBTAG added as a retrieval string.
	
	* src/jacobian.{cc,h}:  Force tests of Jacobian type to follow an enum lists
	of named integeres in (get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians).  This allows
	chaning types of calculations later on by name rather than by numbers.
	Default behaviors are also kept for false statements.  Minor preparations
	for doing line parameters Jacobians are added. There is no way to activate 
	this code yet though.
	
	* src/lin_alg.cc:  Added two speedier ways to calculate the partial
	derivative of a matrix exponent.  This speed is simply achieved by 
	allowing to calculate several partials at once, where these partials 
	are supplied as a Tensor3, with the size of one dimension meaning 
	"number of partial derivatives". One of these methods should probably
	be moved away from this file at some point since it gets its speed by
	assuming that there are two sets of partial derivatives for a level 
	matrix, one upper level and one lower level.  The intention is 
	that we calculate absorption in a layer from absorption at the 
	surrounding levels, so we have a partial influence on a layer from two 
	levels.  In other words, dT(n)/dx(n) and dT(n)/dx(n+1) are not 
	generally nil.
	
	* src/{pressurebroadeningdata,line{mixingdata,scaling}}.{cc,h}:
	Returns partial derivvatives with temperature.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Lots of changes.  As said, each normalization
	factor now returns several partial derivatives.  Only 
	faddeeva_algorithm_916 of the actual line shapes have been adapted 
	to return partial derivatives.
	
	Part of these adaptations might appear overly complicated.  The reason is
	that Hartman-Tran lineshape is somewhat different from the rest, and I 
	want to keep extensions to this lineshape clean.

	* src/m_abs.cc:  All propmat and xsec functions have been changed to
	either return partial derivatives (most of them) or throw warnings
	when propmat partial derivaitves are not supported (e.g., Faraday 
	rotation does this for now for angular parameters).  
	Intentionally, all functions create their internal data structure 
	for knowing to do partial derivatives, and these are strictly 
	tested so that the partial derivative type is allowed.  
	
	Some of the methods get the partial derivatives from perturbations, 
	and these perturbations are known by the internal data.  Still some 
	silliness involved here, e.g., Wind cannot be understood inside 
	propmat_clearsky since the  variable is external.  So Wind partials 
	must be done as frequency  partials, and then have the internal 
	partial of frequency to wind applied externally.  Another thing I 
	have to fix is to allow more perturbations than one for the fields 
	(now u,v,w must have the same perturbations).
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc: lookup partials are calculated by perturbations.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  Does partial derivaitves analytically.  Only 
	Precalc method will allow magnetic partials in the future, probably.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc: Setup simple interface between propmat partial 
	derivatives and present Jacobian scheme.
	
	* src/m_cia.cc:  Same as above.  Note that it assumes that in conversion
	to coefficients, there is no vmr derivative applied.  It therefores
	returns a doubled value when both species are the same.  There is a small
	comment justifying the equations here.  Note that both first and second
	species VMR matters, so the scaling might look odd.  I think this might
	have been missed by the semi-analytical calculation scheme.  Though it
	might be me doing something wrong.
	
	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h:  Added function to return species number.
	
	* src/physics_funcs.{cc,h}:  Added simple partial derivatives for 
	number density and Planck function.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}:  Added (ext2trans_and_ext2dtrans_dx) and 
	(get_ppath_trans_and_dppath_trans_dx) for when propmat_clearsky 
	partials are calculated.  Current FIXME:  How do I use the 
	speedier Landi Degl'Innocenti and Landolfi (2004) method?
	
	(get_ppath_pmat) returns dppath_ex_dx and depends on 
	jacobian_quantities.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}:  Changed a lot.  Added several 
	polarization rotation matrices partial derivaitves.
	Also changed input/output for the Zeeman method wrapper.
	Note that some expressions are direct copies of output from
	Matlab's symbolic toolbox, so they can be lengthy.
	
	* src/partial_derivatives.{h,cc}:  Added.  Change name?
	This treats all cases of internal propmat partials for 
	the cross-section.  It also has a class, PropmatPartialsData,
	that is used and understood by other functions that need more
	than just cross-section partial derivatives data.  This class
	shall, for instance, contain all tests of whether a method is
	eligble for calculating certain partial derivatives.  For instance,
	abs_lookup and continuum cannot calculate line parameters but they
	can calculate NLTE (since there is no NLTE in these models).
	Another example is that Faraday rotation cannot be combined 
	with Zeeman angle changes yet (has to be added manually).
	
	(partial_derivatives_lineshape_dependency) is the function
	that does these calculations.  I have a PDF file available
	that have been shown to some of the developers.  The PDF
	tries to explain each parameter, but it is mostly a 
	collection of mathematical expressions.  It is much more 
	extensive than the presently available outputs suggests.
	
	* All others:  Changed to work around the changes above.  
	Or insignificant changes.

	* arts-2-3-307

	* src/m_oem.cc: Some minor polishing.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Fixed spelling for dxdy.

2015-09-10  Simon Pfreundschuh <simonpf@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-306

	* src/matpackI.* (ConstMatrixView::diagonal): Added function returning
	ConstVectorView of matrix diagonal.

	* src/test_matpack.cc (test_diagonal): Added test function for
	diagonal() function.

2015-09-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-305

	* Now things are prepared for "zero order" inversions, i.e. just
	returning data matching a priori / zero measurement response.
	Retrieval quantities handled so far are just abs. species and
	temperature, but all details should be in place, such as allowing
	length 1 grids.

	* src/m_oem.cc (oem): Extended.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added dxdy.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianAdjustAfterIteration): New.

2015-09-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-304

	* src/m_oem.cc: Work all over the file to make use of new functions
	listed below. Added temperature as treated retrieval quantity.
	Length 1 retrieval grids are now handled.

	* src/methods.cc: Added comment around scope of the hse argument.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianAddAbsSpecies)
	(jacobianAddTemperature): Changed cross-checks between nd and t
	retrievals. It is now allowed to mix these two things, as long as
	temperature is included as retrieval quantity before the species
	using nd. The code to calculate Jacobians does not cover all
	details of this mix of retrieval quantities, but this should not
	have any practical consequences. With the demanded order, things
	get at least right when mapping a iteration state back to t_field
	and vmr_field.

	* src/agendas.cc (define_agenda_data): Added jacobian_do as input to
	inversion_iterate_agenda. And changed back to have y as output.

	* src/interpolation.cc (gp4length1grid): This was before an
	internal help function in jacobian.cc, now polished and moved to this
	file..

	* src/jacobian.cc (jacobian_type_extrapol): This was before an
	internal help function, now polished and included in jacobian.h.

2015-09-10  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-303

	* src/cloudbox.cc (IWCtopnd_MH97): Use same T-margin as introduced in
	atmlab-2-3-116 (I couldn't find a T check in ARTS' MH97 at all :-/ ).
	Seems more practical than disallowing any T>0C.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (dNdD_*): Fixed a couple of comments.

	* src/methods.cc, src/workspace.cc: Couplke of spell fixes and
	previously overlooked adaptations to changed WSM names.

	* cmake/modules/ArtsBuildTexDoc.cmake:

	Add macro ARTS_ADD_SIMPLE_TEX_DOC. Used to compile exercise solutions.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Add exercises to check-xmldata. Also add special target check-classroom.

2015-09-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-299

	Warning: You have to adapt your controlfiles if you're using a custom
	iy_main_agenda that calls iyRadioLink, iyMC or iyLoopFrequencies.
	-> Add Ignore(diy_dx) to iy_main_agenda

	* src/agendas.cc, src/methods.cc:

	Jacobian calculations that relied on recursive calls of the
	iy_main_agenda didn't work since arts-2-3-279. diy_dx was defined as
	an output-only variable and only initialized on the first
	call of iy_main_agenda. In recursive calls the output variable is
	resetted by the workspace engine and hence empty.

	Fixed by adding diy_dx as input to all agendas and methods that can
	call iy_main_agenda recursively:

	iy_main_agenda, iy_space_agenda, iy_surface_agenda,
	iy_surface_sub_agenda[0-5].

	iyEmissionStandard, iyFOS, iySurfaceCallSubAgendaX, iySurfaceFastem,
	iySurfaceRtpropAgenda, iySurfaceRtpropCalc, iyTransmissionStandard.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts:

	Ignore diy_dx in iy_main_agenda__ScattMC and iy_main_agenda__Radiolink.

2015-08-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-297

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Copied all recent
	changes and extensions in iyEmissionStandard. That is, this
	method now supports also mag field retrievals.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Just changes to make the code
	less lengthy. Replaced the Tensor4-s ppath_ext_dwu/v/w with
	ArrayOfTensor4 ppath_ext_dw. And did the same thing for
	corresponding mag field variables. This allowed to avoid some
	if-else, making the code some 40 lines shorter.

2015-08-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-296

2015-08-31  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-294

	* src/zeeman.cc:  Added test that removed a 0-div-0 error when the
	magnetic field is set to zero vectors.  Bug reported by Patrick to
	give all NaNs in the propagation matrix (due to angle being NaNs
	in the Zeeman code).

2015-08-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-293

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmosphereSet3D): The method now also sets
	lat_true and lon_true, to be empty. This matches how the 1D method
	sets lat_grid and lon_grid to be empty.

	* src/jacobian.cc (get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians):
	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Continued work magnetic field
	as jacobian quantity. Should be finished but no proper testing yet.

2015-08-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-292

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_ismar.arts:
	The bandwidth for 664 GHz was incorrectly set to 3 GHz, now

	The below is work in progress, to add magnetic field as jacobian quantity.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Just adopted to
	get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians.

	* src/jacobian.cc (get_pointers_for_analytical_jacobians): Added

2015-08-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-291

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitran): A small correction of
	error message, added 1 to the line
	<< "run 'cmake -DWITH_HITRAN2008=1 ..' and recompile arts";

	* A change to make things more flexible in the met mm part.
	freq_number is now set in the instrument file. It was before
	hard-coded to 1 GHz in apply_metmm.arts.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/apply_metmm.arts:
	See above.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_ismar.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_deimos.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_marss.arts:
	Adopted with met_mm_freq_spacing set to 10 GHz. met_mm_freq_number
	changed back to 12, to match the files below. Tests indicate that
	this number is actually needed, for upward looking views, as some
	bands include ozone lines. While for downward, a value of 2 or 3
	could suffice.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_mhs.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_amsub.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_amsua.arts:

	* arts-2-3-290

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitran):

	Don't require the full catalog filename to match
	hitran2012.par/hitran08.par. Only require that it starts with
	hitran2012/hitran08 (case insensitive). Change proposed by Patrick to
	make it easier to read custom catalogs.

2015-08-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-289

	* arts/controlfiles/instruments/ismar: Removed this folder. The

2015-08-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-286

	* src/methods.cc:

	Add verbosity as input to verbosityInit and verbositySet. Usually, init
	functions only produce output. Verbosity is a special case because
	the workspace engine sets a flag in the Verbosity object whether we're
	inside the main agenda or not. This partial initialization has to be
	preserved when calling verbosityInit/Set. Problem became visible
	because of the changes in arts-2-3-279. Bug reported by Patrick.

2015-08-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	incorrectly included.

2015-08-21  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-282
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Fixed a typo.
	
	The rest is just a preparation.  No code has been changed, but some 
	functions that we have yet to decide necessary have been added.
	
	* src/lin_alg.Pcc,h}:  Added matrix_exp_dmatrix_exp as a method for 
	outputting the matrix exponent and its derivative at once.  Tested
	as a temporary replacement for matrix_exp and the results are identical.
	I have yet to test that the derivative is OK. The function is also based
	on Pade Approximation.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}: Added partial derivatives with respect to the angles.
	I am still unsure if there are easier ways to calculate this.  E.g.,
	exp(LKL^-1)=Lexp(K)L^-1, and L is the only eta variable, so the partial 
	derivative might be easier than partial derivative of all angles.
	Nevertheless, the code is unused for now.  I just need it to check with
	matrix_exp_dmatrix_exp that the dmatrix_exp part is doing a decent job.
	
	Suggestion:  We should agree on a naming scheme for functions and variables
	that can have a direct partial derivatives with respect to some variable(s).
	This should of course only happen if we decide to try the analytical route.
	If so, some clear structure for the multiples of partials required could be
	useful.

	* arts-2-3-272
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Added mirrored Lorentzian line shape.  Useful
	when you only want a single line or species that is mirrored and not
	all lines are to be mirrored.  (E.g., NH3 in Jupiter atmosphere).

	Intercept exceptions crossing the critical region border. Fixes bug
	reported by gerrit in trac ticket #127.

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_open_output_file):

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_ismar.arts:
	Changed met_mm_freq_number to be 7 for all channels. Should be OK
	in most cases, while 12 should be unnecessary high.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_ismar.arts:
	Changed order between H and V for 243 and 664 GHz, to follow
	changed order in L1b file. And new order is better, H before V
	which is the alphabetical order.

	* A small restructuring in met-mm. I have separated the definition
	and the application of the settings. This to make things more
	modular, e.g. to allow that the basic settings can be extracted
	without doing any calculations. Instead of

	  INCLUDE "instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_mhs.arts"

	you must now do

	  INCLUDE "instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_mhs.arts"
	  INCLUDE "instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/apply_metmm.arts"

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/apply_metmm.arts: New.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_ismar.arts:
	This file was not up to date. Not used by anybody!? In addition,
	added dummy data for 424 and 874 channels as they are in place in
	the ISMAR L1b datafiles, and then to get same channel index in
	both places. Adopted to apply_metmm.arts.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_mhs.arts:

	* src/workspace.cc: Update docs for verbosity WSM.

2015-07-03  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-267
	
	Added Hartmann-Tran line shape.  Also added radiation_field
	variable and a method to calculate it.
	
	* controlfiles/*:  Added "Hartmann-Tran" as a line shape call
	where both Hui and Faddeeva where already in use for a third
	test.
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt:  Added m_radiation_field.cc.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Moved sigma calculations outside of 
	xsec_single_line.  This so that all line broadening parameters
	are sent in to xsec_single_line as one block, making it easier
	to get an overview of the broadening scheme.  Also changed
	layout of call to xsec_single_line so that parameters that are
	related to one-another are close-by in the call.  Added five
	broadening parameters we did not have before, and renamed
	deltaf to df_0 and gamma to gamma_0.  All broadening parameters
	are: gamma_0, gamma_2, eta, df_0, df_2, sigma, f_VC, which are
	the Hartmann-Tran inputs for speed-dependent and collisional 
	broadenings.  Note that we presently cannot input these parameters
	since I have yet to add this as a feature of Artscat5, though adding
	this should be a trivial task once data is available.
	
	Added several code comments to make the code easier to follow.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  All line shape functions now take 8 Numerics
	as input.  This is so that the Hartmann-Tran line shape can work
	properly.  Note that it is only tested for default inputs, where
	behaves like faddeeva_algorithm_916.  I need to find some test 
	case to ensure that the implementation is correct for the full 
	calculations.
	
	* src/m_radiation_field.cc, methods.cc, workspace.cc:
	Added the radiation field calculations (planned to be used for 
	internal calculations of t_nlte, but the full code is not 
	yet ready).
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{cc,h}:  Now returns 7 of the line
	broadening terms.  Behavior is identical to before by setting
	pressure broadening terms unknown by Voigt to their canceling
	values.

2015-07-02  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-266

	* src/continua.cc (MPM93RainExt):
	Catch vmr/rainrate=0. case (bugfix). Change from mm/h input to kg/m2/s
	to be consistent with scattering species methods.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (find_nonlinear_continua):
	Added liquidcloud as linear species. Disallow icecloud and rain
	abs_species in lookup table calculations.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc, methods.cc (batch_/atm_fields_compactCleanup):
	Added. scat_species_fieldCleanup equivalent working directly on the
	compact atmospheres (GF4 and ArrayOfGF4). Useful, when LWC/IWC shall be
	used with hydrometeor continuum abs_species.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts:
	Added skin temperature from t_surface variant for blackbody.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts,
	src/rte.cc (emission_rtstep), src/gas_abs_lookup.cc,
	src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit),

	Warning:  This update breaks controlfiles that are using bad 
	partition functions.  To keep using bad partition functions,
	set bad_partition_functions_ok = 1 in atmfield_checkedCalc.
	By "bad" partition function, I mean a partition function that
	is only defined for other temperatures than those that t_field
	contain.
	
	The test on partition functions should ideally be in the 
	abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc, but we have too many definitions of
	the temperature fields for various agendas that rtp_temperature
	and abs_t are not always defined when iy_main_agenda is called,
	so it is only through iy_main_agenda that the temperature can
	be tested.  The user can thus find themselves having fully calculated
	abs_lookup but getting a runtime_error when they then try to use this
	lookup through iy_main_agenda.  So there is some waste of time.
	
	* These controlfiles were using bad partition functions:
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Jupiter.arts
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Mars.arts
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Venus.arts

	controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestRefractPlanets.arts
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts
	controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts
	In the first ten, I recommend using the TIPS function at some point
	after updating, so that the scenarios are actually calculating the 
	correct line scaling.  The latter five are a few degrees outside the
	defined temperature limits.
	
	* src/absorption.h (SetPartitionFctCoeff):  Now also sets a temperature
	range in built-in so that the interpreter reading the built-in can set
	the temperature range properly.
	
	* src/partition_function_data.cc:  Every call to iso() now also sets a
	temperature range.  The temperature range is (150.0, 300.0) for all
	partition functions.  This can of course be updated if anyone shows that
	the temperature range of some species is greater than suggested.  The 
	range was suggested by Jana after some tests she has done.  Note that
	the range cannot be much different, since using TIPS instead of built-in
	produced errors of 0.01 K as stated in a previous commit.
	
	* src/methodds.cc:  Plumbing.
	
	* src/m_checked.cc (atmfields_checkedCalc):  Now takes 
	partition_functions as input.  Also takes a flag, 
	bad_partition_functions_ok, for ignoring when partition_functions
	does not cover the t_field range.  The test is simple: first of all,
	the size of each variable inside partition_functions is checked to see
	if it complies with its type of data.  Then the temparure max of min 
	and min of max of the partition functions are found.  Then, if the flag
	is as per default, we test that min of max and max of min temperatures
	cover t_field.  N.B., that a hard limit of 1 MK is set as the minimum
	min of max temperature.  So if, for whatever reason, higher temperatures
	are needed, then this limit must be changed.

	* arts-2-3-264
	
	* src/linescaling.{cc,h}: Now does not calculate partition function
	if Q(T) or Q(T0) are defined.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Now employs a simple buffer for the partition
	functions,  Only if isotope or line temperatures changes between lines
	at a pressure level will the partition function be recalculated.

	* src/continua.cc, src/interpolation.cc, src/interpolation_poly.cc,
	src/m_jacobian.cc, src/m_optproperties.cc, src/ppath.cc, src/sensor.cc:

	Use the DEBUG_ONLY(...) macro around variable definitions and argument

	* arts-2-3-261

	* Comment on Richard previous commit: The slowdown when using TIPS data
	is due to an assertion in the interpolation routines. It calls
	is_increasing which has a large impact on performance (long vector
	checked in every iteration inside xsec_species).

	With a release build (cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .), it
	is only marginally slower than using the builtin coeffs.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSkyTips.arts:

	Add test case for TIPS.

	Move artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts to slow tests.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc): now properly returns a
	Tensor6 nlte_source_field.  If t_nlte_field.empty() is false the field is
	one stokes_dim smaller than propmat_clearsky_field.  If 
	t_nlte_field.empty() is true, so is nlte_source_field.empty().

	Now the externalized partition functions can be used by everyone.
	Note that there is probably a bug presently that makes the calculations
	very slow.  I.e., make check with built-in takes one quarter the time
	as using the gridded data.  There might be a copy-bug 
	in either (CalculatePartitionFctFromData) or in the calls to 
	(CalculatePartitionFctFromData) and (CalculatePartitionFctFromCoeff).
	That or the interpolation is very slow.
	
	This is quite a significant update, because with TIPS data instead
	of built-in data two fast test fail for deviating from the minimal allowed
	error.  These tests are: 
	arts.ctlfile.fast.artscomponents.clearsky.TestClearSky
	arts.ctlfile.fast.artscomponents.groundbased.TestWinds
	Clearsky has limit at 0.01 K and is 1% above this. Wind has limit
	at 0.0001 K but is 1100% above this in the test.  So the new partition
	functions makes about 0.01 K difference to built-in.  I did not investigate
	why yet.
	
	Will make check so that the eternal partition function is valid for 
	the provided atmospheric temperature field.  By Jana's advice, the check 
	should allow us to forcefully calculate with a bad partition function,
	and I agree since it gives errors of only 0.01 K for the fast testcases,
	and we mostly care about larger errors.
	
	FIXME remaining: PF tag in Artscat5 (for easy playing with partition
	functions) does not work for now.
	
	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: 
	Calls partition_functionsInitFromBuiltin.  If you do not include
	general.arts, your controlfile will now fail.
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added linescaling.cc to handle scaling calculations.
	I wanted this part of LineRecord but this seems impossible since
	SpeciesAuxData is in absorption.h and linerecord.h is a dependency of
	absorption.h.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Appended old partition calculation functions to
	_OldUnused.  These should be removed at some point. partition_functions
	is now passed along to xsec_species and xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper.
	GetLineScalingData moved from LineRecord to linescaling.cc so absorption.cc
	depends on linescaling.h.
	
	I also changed xsec_single_line so the numeric isotopic ratio is passed
	on instead of the SpeciesAuxData variable since I found that part strange.
	
	* src/linerecord.{h,cc}: Moved GetLineScalingData from linerecord.
	
	* src/linescaling.{cc,h}: New files.  To keep line scaling data separated
	from absorption.cc.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc, src/m_zeeman.cc, src/methods.cc, src/zeeman.{cc,h}:
	All pass partition_functions onto linescaling.

	Updated non-LTE formalism in ARTS to fit with Patrick's suggestion to
	only return the difference between LTE and non-LTE source term.
	
	That is, instead of doing dy/ds = - K*y + E*B, we now assume that
	dy/ds = - K*y + K*B + J_n for the radiative transfer.  In this equation,
	J_n = (E-K)*B, and it is returned from propmat_clearsky_agenda when
	nlte_do is true.  As a consequence of these changes 
	propmat_source_clearsky has been removed from workspace and all functions
	that previously had to return it so that E would be complete for all 
	absorption cases.  (This also saves some time, since, e.g., continua
	will no longer have to add onto E, since its non-LTE contribution is
	nil, its J_n contribution is also nil.)
	
	One negative consequence of this update is that it also formally changes
	a behavior of m_rte.cc.  Previously, E was pressure level-averaged for a
	layer in m_rte.cc so that E_bar was (E'+E'')/2, where E_bar is the 
	average and E' and E'' is the E of two adjacent levels.  This E_bar was 
	multiplied by Planck's function in emission_rtstep, and Planck's function 
	was also averaged over two levels so B_bar = (B'+B'')/2.  Thus we had
	(E'B'+E'B''+E''B'+E''B'')/4 as the second term of the first equation
	above.  Now, since J_n is returned per level, 
	J_n_bar = ([E'B'-K'B'+E''B''-K''B'')/2, and since K*B is averaged as
	before, i.e., K_bar*B_bar = (K'B'+K'B''+K''B'+K''B'')/4, we end up with
	K_bar*B_bar+J_n_bar = (2E'B'-K'B'+K'B''+2E''B''-K''B'+K''B'')/4.
	
	The difference above is of course very small when K or B remains 
	fairly close to K_bar or B_bar, respectively, but is nevertheless there
	and I do not know how to deal with it.  Nor do I know if the previous
	formalism was better or worse than present formalism for our layer
	formations.  I suspect that the ideal solution is to force both of these
	definitions of K*B+J_n to be similar in the pathing somehow, so as to
	ensure that the atmospheric absorption is not misscalculated, but this
	is not part of the present update.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/stokesrot/TestStokesRotation.arts:
	Now touches nlte_source instead of propmat_source_clearsky.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  xsec_single_line now returns source cross-section
	as source non-LTE ratio minus absorption non-LTE ratio times the LTE 
	cross-section, instead of, as it did before, the source non-LTE ratio
	times the LTE cross-section.
	
	* src/agendas.cc: propmat_source_clearsky is replaced by nlte_source in
	propmat_clearsky_agenda.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc: nlte_sourceFromTemperatureAndSrcCoefPerSpecies added.
	This function multiplies the coefficients with the Planck function.
	Removed source from propmat_clearskyAddFromAbsCoefPerSpecies. 
	Removed source calculations from all workspace methods that do not 
	need it.
	
	* src/{m_,}zeeman.{cc,h}: Changed to the new behavior.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}: Changed emission_rtstep to take sourcebar as input.
	Behavior inside should be identical but as above, averaging is done 
	elsewhere now. get_ppath_pmat returns ppath_nlte_source instead of 
	ppath_abs.  Same size of both variabels.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc:  This is where averaging now happends over J_n instead of
	over E, causing the concern raised above.  In iyEmissionStandard.
	
	Remaining unlisted files all comply with changes mentioned.  Basically,
	a few names have changed.  That is all.

2015-06-22  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-251
	
	Added a few tests to reduce assertion risk for people trying 
	to trigger NLTE assertions.  With these additions, it should
	not be possible to trigger assertion errors anymore.
	
	* src/m_linerecord.cc:  Tests that vibrational energies are larger
	than 0.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:  Line scaling now depends on NLTE condition
	to stop people from setting up NLTE condititions and then turning them
	off again to find an assertion.

2015-06-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-250

	* Changed how to setup nlte calculations.

	Similar to jacobians, sensor and cloudbox, there is one method to turn
	NLTE calculation off (nlteOff). It resizes NLTE data structure to empty
	and sets the new WSV flag ntle_do to 0.

	NLTE calculations are enabled by setting up the input data and then
	calling nlteSetByQuantumIdentifiers. This method also sets the new
	WSV flag nlte_do to 1. There will be more nlteSet* methods in the
	future.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:

	Replace Tensor4SetConstant for t_nlte_field and Touch
	nlte_quantum_identifiers by nlteOff.

	Eventually, ntlteOff should be removed from here and added to all
	controlfiles. This would be consistent with sensorOff, cloudboxOff and
	jacobianOff.

	* src/workspace.cc: Add new flag nlte_do.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_checked.cc (nlteOff):

	New WSM to turn NLTE calculations off.

	* src/m_linerecord.cc (nlteSetByQuantumIdentifiers), src/methods.cc:

	Renamed from abs_lines_per_speciesMatchNLTEQuantumIdentifiers. Added
	call to new chk_nlte function.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (calc_lookup_error),
	src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesInit):

	nlte_checked -> nlte_do

	* src/check_input.{cc,h} (chk_nlte),
	src/m_checked.cc (ntle_checkedCalc):

	Former WSM ntle_checkedCalc moved from m_checked to check_input and
	adapted.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/**/*.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/TestOdinSMR.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/TestOdinSMR_1D.arts:

	Remove nlte_checkedCalc.

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper): Ident.

2015-06-18  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-249

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky//TestBatch.arts,
	TestBatch.ybatch.ref.xml: Added. A clear-sky batch test case/example
	including lookup table calculation.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Added the above. Moved AbsParticle test
	to category 'slow'.

2015-06-18  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-248

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/
	TestPlanetIsoRatios.[Venus,Mars,Jupiter].y_reference.xml:
	Corrected reference values (accidentially the previous references
	corresponded to old line data).

2015-06-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-247

	* src/quantum_parser_hitran.cc:

	(parse_a1_sym_hitran): Ignore 'g' for O2 (only appears for lines
	between 30 and 990 kHz). This appears to be another undocumented case.
	The HITRAN documentation only describes 'd' and 'q' as possible values
	for O2. Reported by Mathias.

	(parse_a1_br_hitran): Allow letters up to 4 clicks away from Q.

	* src/quantum.{cc,h} (operator<<, operator>>, Set,
	IsValidQuantumNumberName):

	Added missing quantum number 'Sym'.

2015-06-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-246

	* Added usage of .empty() in functions listed below. This is just
	what I found by a quick search for == 0 in the files considered.
	.empty() should likely be used at many more places. But this I
	leave for others / the future.

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_conv_flagAbsBT, doit_conv_flagLsq)
	(doit_i_fieldUpdate1D, doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D, DoitInit)
	(DoitCalc):
	* src/m_checked.cc (sensor_checkedCalc):
	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxSetAutomatically, ParticleTypeAdd)
	(ParticleType2abs_speciesAdd, pnd_fieldCalcFrompnd_field_raw):
	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (FieldFromGriddedFieldCheckLatLonHelper):
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral):

	(sensor_responseInit):
	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianClose):
	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_pmat):

2015-06-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-245

	* src/matpack{I,II,II,IV,V,VI,VI}.{cc,h}, src/test_matpack.cc:

	Add 'empty' member function to all matpack-Const* types.
	It returns true if any dimension is of length zero.

	* ChangeLog: Remove conflict marker.

2015-06-18 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-244

	* src/methods.cc:  Added text to better describe line matching
	functions.  Suggested by Patrick.

2015-06-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-243

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Added a temporary solution,
	to get qarts to work without a lot of hazzle:
	Touch( nlte_quantum_identifiers )

	* arts-2-3-242

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/
	TestPlanetIsoRatios.[Venus,Mars,Jupiter].y_reference.xml:
	Added reference data missing in commit arts-2-3-240.

2015-06-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-241

	* This code was provided by Richard and committed by me after
	fixing the bug mentioned further down in my changes:

	* src/linerecord.h (SetElow): Added.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_linerecord.cc
	(abs_linesReplaceWithLines,
	abs_linesReplaceParameterWithLinesParameter):

	Added methods to replace line data. The lines are matched by quantum
	numbers.

	* My changes:

	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.cc
	(PressureBroadeningData::GetVectorFromData):

	Fix bug in indexing for PB_AIR_AND_WATER_BROADENING that left
	uninitialized values.

	* src/linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.cc
	(PartitionFunctionData::Type2StorageTag):

	Remove string resize statement that has no effect.

	* src/linerecord.h (SetPartitionFunctionData, SetLineMixingData,
	SetPressureBroadeningData):

	Pass function arguments by reference to avoid unnecessary copying of
	objects.

	* m_linerecord.cc (abs_linesReplaceParameterWithLinesParameter):

	Change type of lr inside loop to a const reference to avoid unnecessary
	copying of line records.

	* src/m_linerecord.cc (abs_linesReplaceWithLines,
	abs_linesReplaceParameterWithLinesParameter):

	Define ostringstream only where needed because it is expensive to
	create.

2015-06-17  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-240

	* adapted ARTS-XML-DATA-2-2-3 equivalent changes:

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/IsoRatios_H2O[orig,mani].xml:
	Updated N2 iso ratios to state of built-in data (which had changed by
	2014-04-07). Fixes broken TestIsoRatio.arts case.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestPlanetIsoRatios.arts,
	TestPlanetIsoRatios.[Venus,Mars,Jupiter].y_reference.xml:
	Apply Compare. Reference data for PlanetIso case added.

	* doc/uguide/absorption_theory.tex, absorption.tex: Spell/Grammar fixes.

2015-06-16  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-239

	* src/cloudbox.cc
	(pnd_fieldMP48): Modified to be consistent with dNdD_MP48, now both
	applying PRtopnd_MP48. Improved mean density estimation initialization.

	(PRtopnd_MP48): Fixed bug in distribution parameter setting.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (dNdD_MP48): Introduced choice of input unit.
	Mimicking unit conversion done in pnd_fieldMP48 as far as possible.

	* src/methods.cc
	(dNdD_MP48): Adapted to interface changes due to unit conversion change
	above. Corrected documentation.

	(dNdD_*): Removed misleading info in explanation. Added unit info to
	output parameter descriptor.

	WARNING:  This update breaks your controlfiles.  It adds a test for
	NLTE compatibility mode for the setups.  If you run AtmRawRead in the
	past, and you have abs_lines_per_species, abs_xsec_agenda, and 
	propmat_clearsky_agenda defined, you should apply nlte_checkedCalc
	before calling either of the previous agendas.  If you do not call
	AtmRawRead or have not defined abs_lines_per_species, you must
	either manually set nlte_checked using FlagOn( nlte_checked ) to
	call these agendas, or you should define t_nlte_field and 
	nlte_quantum_identifiers as zero-sized variables and call 
	nlte_checkedCalc.  
	
	In the controlfiles included with ARTS FlagOn( nlte_checked ) is
	used to flag NLTE as safe in those files that are affected.  It is
	recommended to use the other approach whenever possible, and run the
	full nlte_checkedCalc.
	
	* src/linerecord.cc:  Fixed bug in NLTE code.  Forgot to divide
	energy by Boltzmann's constant.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc, src/methods.cc:  abs_xsec_per_speciesInit, 
	abs_xsec_per_speciesInitWithSource, propmat_clearskyInit, and 
	propmat_clearskyInitWithSource now demands that nlte_checked is true.
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc:  In manual Init-call the nlte_checked is set to
	one, as this is how propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked is handeled.
	
	* src/m_checked.cc:  Ironed out some bugs in the checking routine.
	
	* src/m_linerecord.cc:  Added strict uniqueness check to 
	abs_lines_per_speciesMatchNLTEQuantumIdentifiers so no
	QuantumIdentifier is overwriting another QuantumIdentifier.

2015-06-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-237

	* src/quantum_parser_hitran.{cc,h}:

	Added support for OH.

	Added special case for group 6 for OH (GI_GROUP6OH) because the catalog
	format is different for this molecule than for others.

	Set group 6 to undefined for NO, ClO, OH and don't parse it due to undetermined format
	issue of the catalog that need further investigation. We compile a list
	with these issues to ask to the HITRAN guys.

	(postprocess_group6oh_hitran): Added.

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Remove old quantum number parsing code. All molecules that were
	supported by the old code are now covered by the new quantum parser.

	* src/m_linerecord.cc (abs_lines_per_speciesMatchNLTEQuantumIdentifiers):

	Use proper != comparison operator instead of (!X == Y).

2015-06-12 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-236
	
	* src/m_checked.cc:  Added test for LTE case to ensure that overflow
	does not occur in low level functionality (nlte_checkedCalc).
	
	* src/quantum_parser_hitran.cc:  Added quantum parsing to CO2, H2O,
	and O3.  Their quantum numbers should now be read properly, except for
	the local "Sym" field of CO2.  We are still debating how to set "Sym"-
	fields consistently.

2015-06-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-235

	* src/quantum_parser.h, src/quantum_parser_hitran.cc:

	Added species argument to parsing functions to cover species dependent
	special cases in catalog format.

	Added support for NO2, HO2, NO, ClO.

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Use quantum parser instead of the old code for the added species.

2015-06-11 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-234
	
	This update brings the required user space availability to the low level
	NLTE variables.  At the moment, this requires using Artscat5 to
	set relevant quantum numbers for the mathing functions to work,
	or to use HITRAN for those species that have quantum number reading.
	
	The new parser from Oliver will be used to read more quantum numbers
	for more species directly from HITRAN in a few updates.
	
	I will add a test case and documentation when I am more certain we 
	are doing things the right way.
	
	* src/linerecord.cc:  The previously inactivated NLTE part is now 
	active again in (GetLineScalingData).  If no NLTE information is
	available to the line, then it will behave as if using atmospheric
	temperatures.
	
	* src/linerecord.h:  Added four line state parameters for NLTE.
	These are used in (GetLineScalingData) and set externally.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Minor fixes to make formatting work with
	my IDE for (faddeeva_algorithm_916).
	
	* src/m_atmospheres.cc:  Made nlte_quantum_identifiers a default
	output for (AtmRawRead) and (AtmWithNLTERawRead).
	(AtmWithNLTERawRead) throws a quandary if nlte_quantum_identifiers
	and t_nlte_field_raw are not of the same size.
	
	* src/m_checked.cc:  Added a, for now, non-default test of the NLTE
	setup.  This will catch errors in source function definitions in
	the two relevant agendas.  Not run by default for now.
	
	*  src/m_linerecord.cc: Added function to make lines aware of their
	NLTE data.  (abs_lines_per_speciesMatchNLTEQuantumIdentifiers) can
	also set the vibrational energies of the lines as a GIN.  This is 
	presently the only way to set vibrational energies.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Modified: AtmWithNLTERawRead and AtmRawRead.
	Added: abs_lines_per_speciesMatchNLTEQuantumIdentifiers and
	nlte_checkedCalc.
	
	* src/workspace.cc:  Added: nlte_checked and nlte_quantum_identifiers.

2015-06-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-233

	* New quantum number parser. Work in progress.
	Only O2 is supported right now.

	* src/quantum_parser.h, src/quantum_parser_hitran.{cc,h}:

	Implemented new parser to replace the quantum number parsing code in
	LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream with a more generic version.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add quantum parser cc files.

	* src/array.h (Array<base>::push_back_n):

	Add convenience function to add the same element several times.

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Use the new parser for O2 quantum numbers.

	* src/quantum.{cc,h}: Added QN_alpha.

2015-06-10 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-232
	
	* src/quantum.{h,cc}, src/linerecord.cc:  Added and changed some
	quantum number names to be consistent with HITRAN.

2015-06-09 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-231
	
	Reverting some files by Patrick's advice.
	
	* src/agendas.cc: Reverting iy_main_agenda to not take 
	t_nlte_field. Changed all other code back to previous executing 
	style.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts:
	Now touch t_nlte_field.
	
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc,src/m_doit.cc,src/m_jacobian.cc,
	src/m_rte.cc,src/m_surface.cc:  No more dummy t_nlte_field.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  No t_nlte_field in yCalc and iyCalc.
	
	* src/rte.{cc,h}:  So get_iy, iyb_calc, and iyb_calc_body
	no longer has t_nlte_field as input.

2015-06-09  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-230

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ScatteringParticleTypeAndMetaRead):
	Removed spurious cout.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts:
	Minor clean up.

2015-06-09 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-229
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Changed how non-resonant O2 is handled.
	Now the method follows from the Debye lineshape approximating
	VVW/2 line shape.
	
	* src/linemixingdata.{cc,h}:  Adapted tag.  This could break
	old Artscat5 files but the physics is better.  LM NR -0.5
	now adapts VVW line shape to VVW/2 for the non-resonant
	line/band of AER's catalog.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Added comment that the lineshape for
	O2 non-resonant is not used and should not be used.  Should
	it be removed?

2015-06-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-228

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Earth.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/helpers/TestRegridding.arts:

	Adapt ERA40 path for restructured arts-xml-data.

2015-06-09  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-227

	* m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc (ScatteringParticleTypeAndMetaRead):
	Pass scat_data locations as ArrayOfString instead of in a file. Derive
	meta data location from scat_data location applying naming convention
	scat_data: */*.xml* -> scat_meta: */*.meta.xml*.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestDoitJacobians.arts:
	Adapted to ScatteringParticleTypeAndMetaRead changes.

	* controlfiles/testdata/ScatteringMetaFile_H2Oliquid.xml,
	SingleScatteringFile_H2Oice.xml, ScatteringMetaFile_H2Oice.xml,
	SingleScatteringFile_H2Oliquid.xml:
	Adapt for ScatteringParticleTypeAndMetaRead changes (we can't build
	relative paths from the file-of-files anymore).

2015-06-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-226

	* src/linerecord.cc (ReadFromArtscat5Stream):

	Don't throw a runtime error for invalid lower quantum numbers. The
	invalid number could be the next tag. If it isn't, an error is thrown
	anyway in the next step when it's parsed as a tag. Fixed bug reported
	by Richard.

	WARNING:  This update breaks controlfiles that use AtmRawRead
	wit static parameters.  It also breaks controlfiles that specifies their
	own propmat_clearsky_agenda, abs_xsec_agenda, and iy_main_agenda.
	
	To fix, Ignore() the workspace in the error of the agendas, and 
	switch to the new way to use AtmRawRead, i.e.,
	AtmRawRead(basename = basename).  Alternatively, you can 
	t_nlte_field_raw in the documented position to continue using the old 
	static call.
	
	As is, this code passes the full checks.
	
	The intrusive change is necessary because we must pass the non-LTE 
	temperatures along to the absorption agenda in a sane manner (my own
	method is not to use for mass adoption).
	
	* controlfiles/{artscomponents,planetary_toolbox,instruments}/*:
	Changed AtmRawRead to only give the basename, and to ignoring 
	the agenda variables where special agendas are defined.
	
	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Automatically ignore 
	t_nlte_field in unaffected iy_main_agenda.
	
	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:  Defines t_nlte_field as 0-sized.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}: (xsec_species) takes abs_t_nlte.
	This is passed along as a vector to the line strength scaling function.
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) also takes abs_t_nlte and treats it
	the same as does (xsec_species).
	
	* src/agendas.cc:  rtp_temperature_nlte is passed to propmat_clearsky_agenda,
	abs_t_nlte is passed to abs_xsec_agenda, and t_nlte_field is passed to
	iy_main_agenda.
	
	* src/disort.cc: (dtauc_ssalbCalc) calls propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute
	with a dummy rtp_temperature_nlte.
	
	* src/doit.cc: (cloud_RT_no_background) calls propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute
	with a dummy rtp_temperature_nlte. (cloud_ppath_update1D_planeparallel) calls
	propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute twice with a dummy rtp_temperature_nlte.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:  Fixed small bug with O2 quantum numbers.  O2 only has
	v1 regardless of ARTSCAT-4 reporting 3 v-numbers.
	Also changing (GetLineScalingData) since we need to treat this in another 
	way than before.  This function is still in transition... so it produces a
	warning that will be removed as soon as we have better quantum number reading
	available for HITRAN.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc: (AbsInputFromRteScalars) now also works on abs_t_nlte and 
	rtp_temperature_nlte.  (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLine) now takes abs_t_nlte
	as input so that abs_t_nlte can be passed to (xsec_species) or 
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper).  (propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly) Now
	takes rtp_temperature_nlte and converts it to abs_t_nlte through
	(AbsInputFromRteScalars) to pass abs_t_nlte along to
	abs_xsec_agendaExecute.
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc: (abs_lookupCalc) now passes a dummy this_t_nlte
	variable to abs_xsec_agendaExecute.  (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc) now 
	passes a dummy rtp_temperature_nlte to propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute.
	Most infrastructure is already in place to have the propmat_field calculated 
	using the non-LTE temperatures.  (calc_lookup_error) passes a dummy
	rtp_temperature_nlte to (propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly).
	
	* src/m_atmosphere.cc: (AtmFieldsCalc) now takes t_nlte_field_raw to
	compute t_nlte_field.  Optional behaviour can be set using 
	nlte_when_negative (see documentation).  The non-LTE interpolation
	follows closely the implementation of the VMR interpolation, using the 
	same functions except when nlte_when_negative is given.
	(AtmFieldsCalcExpand1D) behaves the same as (AtmFieldsCalc).
	(AtmRawRead) must now set t_nlte_field_raw to zero-size for other functions
	to behave as expected.  This breaks a lot of controlfiles using the 
	static variable passings to AtmRawRead.  (AtmWithNLTERawRead) is new 
	identical to (AtmRawRead) except that it expects there to be a 
	$BASENAME.t_nlte.xml file in the basename directory.  And that this file
	should contain the non-LTE state of the atmosphere.  The functionality of
	(AtmWithNLTERawRead) could still change to also require $BASENAME.qi.xml
	for quantum identifiers and even $BASENAME.ev.xml for state energies, but me 
	and Oliver are still in discussions on how to implement this in the best way,
	
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc: (iyCloudRadar) Now creates a dummy t_nlte_field to
	pass along to (get_ppath_atmvars) so that ppath_t_nlte can be set.
	ppath_t_nlte is then passed to (get_ppath_pmat).  (yCloudRadar) creates a 
	dummy t_nlte_field to pass into iy_main_agendaExecute.
	
	* src/m_doit.cc: (DoitGetIncoming) creates a dummy t_nlte_field to pass into
	(get_iy).  (DoitGetIncoming1DAtm) mimics the above.
	
	* src/m_fos.cc:  (fos) mimics (iyCloudRadar).
	
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:  (jacobianCalcAbsSpeciesPerturbations) creates
	a dummy t_nlte_field to send into (iyb_calc).
	(jacobianCalcTemperaturePerturbations) does the same as above.
	(jacobianDoit) sends a dummy t_nlte_field to (yCalc) twice.
	
	* src/m_rte.cc: (iyCalc) takes t_nlte_field as input to execute
	iy_main_agendaExecute.  (iyEmissionStandard) also takes t_nlte_field
	as input to calculate ppath_t_nlte, which is used in (get_ppath_pmat).
	(yCalc_mblock_loop_body) also takes t_nlte_field as input to pass into
	(iyb_calc).  (yCalc) takes t_nlte_field as input to pass into 
	(yCalc_mblock_loop_body) twice.  (yCalcAppend) also takes t_nlte_field
	as input to pass into (yCalc).
	
	* src/m_surface.cc:  (iySurfaceFastem) creates a dummy t_nlte_field to
	pass to iy_main_agendaExecute. (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda) and 
	(iySurfaceRtpropCalc) behaves the same.
	
	* src/m_transmitter.cc:  (iyRadioLink) mimics (iyCloudRadar).
	(iyTransmissionStandar) mimics (iyCloudRadar) as well but passes
	the dummy t_nlte_field to more get_ppath_pmat.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  (propmat_clearskyAddZeeman) takes rtp_temperature_nlte
	as input, turns it into a Matrix in AbsInputFromRteScalars, and 
	pass it along to (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper_with_zeeman).
	(propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc) mimics the above.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  (AtmWithNLTERawRead) is new and behavior explained 
	above.  The methods that have been changed otherwise are:
	AbsInputFromRteScalars,
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines,
	AtmFieldsCalc,
	AtmFieldsCalcExpand1D,
	AtmRawRead,
	iyCalc,
	iyEmissionStandard,
	propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly,
	propmat_clearskyAddZeeman,
	propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc,
	yCalc, and
	yCalcAppend.
	
	* src/montecarlo.cc: (clear_rt_vars_at_gp) sends a dummy 
	rtp_temperature_nlte into propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute.
	(loudy_rt_vars_at_gp) does the same.
	
	* src/rte.{cc.h}: get_iy has t_nlte_field as input to pass into 
	iy_main_agendaExecute.  (get_ppath_atmvars) outputs ppath_t_nlte
	from t_nlte_field that has been interpolated per nlte energy level
	into a matrix similar to ppath_vmr.  (get_ppath_pmat) now takes
	ppath_t_nlte as input to pass it into propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute
	if there are levels available.  (iyb_calc_body) now takes t_nlte_field
	as input to pass it into iy_main_agendaExecute.  (iyb_calc) also takes 
	t_nlte_field as input to pass this into (iyb_calc_body).
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}:  (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper_with_zeeman) takes
	abs_t_nlte and pass it into (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper).
	
	* src/workspace.cc: abs_t_nlte is new.  It behaves as the VMR equivalent
	and has size of nlte levels and p_grid, or 0. This will likely change to the size
	of an ArrayOfQuantumIdentifier -with_some_name- in the near future.
	rtp_temperature_nlte is also new.  This also behaves the same as its VMR 
	equivalent.  Size is nlte levels or zero.  t_nlte_field is also new.
	It has size [NLTE levels, p_grid, lat_grid, lon_grid ] or zero.
	t_nlte_field_raw is also new.  It has size [NLTE levels][N_p, N_lat, N_lon].
	All of the above behaves as the VMR equivalent but can be size zero when NLTE
	is not wanted.  Also, instead of size from species, size is from the number
	of non-LTE levels.

2015-06-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-220

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Added workaround for detection of BLAS. Older cmake versions require
	fortran to be enabled for the FindBLAS macro to work. Therefore, for
	cmake < 2.8.8, fortran language support is now automatically turned on.

2015-06-03  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-219

	* src/CMakeLists.txt, CMakeLists.txt:

	Fix bug in BLAS detection reported by jana. Cmake did not fail when
	the required BLAS library wasn't found. Instead compilation failed
	trying to link against -lOFF.
	Moved code from src/ to toplevel CMakeLists.txt file and changed
	detection code to be consistent with other libraries.

	* README: Added blas to required dependencies.

	* arts-2-3-217

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCalc, yCalc_mblock_loop_body): iy resp. y now

	* arts-2-3-216

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit):
	Skip DOIT calculation if effective perturbation is 0 (happens for rel
	perturbations if x_ref==0) and set respective jacobians directly to 0.

2015-06-01 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-215

	* src/zeeman.cc:  Fixed bug reported by Patrick about source 
	functions.  For now the only test that fails when WithSource
	is active in Init is ycalcappend.TestYCalcAppend.  Note that
	this does not mean that most tests even use the source.
	
	Big fixme remaining:  The agenda checking must change so that
	we enforce InitWithSource in both the relevant agendas.

2015-06-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-214

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Had missed the factor 0.5
	when calculating absbar and extbar.

	* src/rte.cc (emission_rtstep): Complete code for non-LTE now in
	place. But lack proper tests to be totally sure that all OK.

2015-06-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-213

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Compare): NaNs now handled. NaN compared
	to NaN is allowed. This gives a zero difference. But NaN compared
	to any other value results in an error.

	* src/rte.cc (emission_rtstep): Some code added for non-LTE (but
	it is not complete).

2015-06-01 Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* src/absorption.cc:  Fix to a horrible bug in the phase calculations
	that I introduced with one of my previous commits.  FIXME:  I need to
	design a test that catches this error if I or someone else 
	messes up the code again.  Problem:  phase matrix gives bad values
	but all Zeeman tests succeed.

2015-05-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-209

	* Work in progress ...

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Reverted template definitions
	of propmat_clearsky_agenda. Now propmat_clearskyInit used agian.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Adopted to changes in
	get_ppath_pmat and emission_rtstep. Code in place for calculation
	of spectra, but not for jacobians. The combination non-LTE and
	jacobians results in an error.

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): Basic adoption to changes in get_ppath_pmat
	and emission_rtstep. So far just an error if there is any non-LTE
	point.

	* src/rte.cc (emission_rtstep): Extended to also have input
	arguments for non-LTE situations. But no code yet added for non_LTE.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar):
	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink, iyTransmissionStandard):
	Updated to changes in get_ppath_pmat. All should be ready here as
	the methods do not operate with emission.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs): Renamed

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_pmat): New name of function above. Two
	output arguments added, to handle introduction of propmat_source_clearsky.

2015-05-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-208

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts:

	Replaced by richard's new version that caused crashes. See fix below.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc):

	Define src_xsec_per_species as private in OpenMP loop. Otherwise random
	crashes appear because the same variable is resized by different
	threads at the same time.

2015-05-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-207

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_single_line, xsec_species_linemixing_wrapper):

	Create a non-const empty Vector variable to fix error.
	This is necessary because objects that are created inline are constant!

	All tests succeed again.

2015-05-29  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-206
	
	Fix some bugs in the previous commit.  Added initialization schemes for 
	propmat_clearsky and abs_xsec_per_species that makes propmat_source_clearsky 
	and src_xsec_per_species same as their older counterparts.
	
	When changeing agendas.cc to initialize with the new initilization schemes 
	(since they should not change the older parts), then these errors remain:
	
	35 - arts.ctlfile.fast.artscomponents.montecarlo.TestMonteCarloDataPrepare (OTHER_FAULT)
	39 - arts.ctlfile.fast.instruments.amsu.TestAMSUB_fast (OTHER_FAULT)
	40 - arts.ctlfile.fast.instruments.ici.TestICI_fast (OTHER_FAULT)
	41 - arts.ctlfile.fast.instruments.mhs.TestMHS_fast (OTHER_FAULT)
	
	I tried fixing the montecarlo error but the program exits with "everything is fine",
	even though it reportedly fails.  Same thing for the AMSUB testcase.
	So I am confused by these errors and gave up.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Actually sends NLTE ratios into xsec_single_line now.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Fix some error handling.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  The new methods are called propmat_clearskyInitWithSource and
	abs_xsec_per_speciesInitWithSource.
	
	* src/montecarl.cc:  Left minimal formatting improvements around after giving 
	up on the real problem.

2015-05-29  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-205
	
	This update adds the source function propagation matrix as output.  
	This separate source function is required for NLTE capabilities.
	It is quite a touchy update for several files.  The absorption part
	should work identically to as it did before.  I still need to perform
	more tests to say when the source function behaves in a sane manner.
	
	In particular, more error catchers must be added.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}: xsec_source added to xsec_species output. It
	is tested that this Matrix behaves the same as xsec_attenuation or
	that it is 0-sized.  The latter means no direct source calculations,
	and the former means there are direct source calculations.
	xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper also returns the source in the same
	way.
	
	xsec_single_line now takes different inputs than before, and one of
	these is the boolean calc_src to calculate the source.  There is
	presently no way to use this feature, since I temporarily have 
	disabled it due to NLTE temperature fields not being available yet.
	
	* src/agendas.cc:  Added "propmat_source_clearsky" as output of
	"propmat_clearsky_genda" and added "src_xsec_per_species" as
	output of "abs_xsec_agenda".
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:  All line strength scaling are now gathered
	in LineRecord::GetLineScalingData.  The function follows Futbolin
	approach and outputs both nlte scalars as well as partition function
	and Boltzmann factors.
	
	* src/linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.{cc,h}: Are under reconstruction.
	Will change quite a lot soon.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Added src_coef, src_coef_per_species, and 
	src_xsec_per_species to coefCalcFromXsec.  Mimics the abs equivalent
	behavior when of the right size.
	
	abs_xsec_per_speciesInit inits src_xsec_per_species to a zero matrix
	with the same tag-length as abs_xsec_per_species.  Init at other size 
	than zero needs to be handled somehow still.
	
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines calls xsec_species with 
	src_xsec_per_species.
	
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts mirrors src_xsec_per_species behavior to
	abs_xsec_per_species behavior if matrix is non-0-length.
	
	propmat_clearskyAddFromAbsCoefPerSpecies takes src_coef_per_species and
	inserts to propmat_source_clearsky if propmat_source_clearsky is 
	non-empty.
	
	propmat_clearskyAddParticles mirrors propmat_source_clearsky to 
	propmat_clearsky behavior if propmat_source_clearsky is non-empty.
	
	propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly executes all of the abs_xsec_agenda with
	source-related inputs. 
	
	propmat_clearskyForceNegativeToZero  mirrors propmat_source_clearsky to 
	propmat_clearsky behavior if propmat_source_clearsky is non-empty.
	
	propmat_clearskyZero and propmat_clearskyAddFaraday are ignored so if 
	these are your only input you will have to touch propmat_source_clearsky.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/stokesrot/TestStokesRotation.arts:
	Added Touch( propmat_source_clearsky ).
	
	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc:  Has been mostly ignored.
	
	propmat_clearskyAddFromLookup adds the absorption to propmat_source_clearsky.
	Note that this means that lookup cannot handle source being different from 
	absorption.
	
	* src/m_cia.cc: abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA mirors what happens in 
	absorption to source if src_xsec_per_species is initialized.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  Mirrors to propmat_source_clearsky except for
	what happens inside xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper, which can 
	diverge the two.  Offers a polarized source function if initialized.
	propmat_clearskyAddZeeman and propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc
	behave qualitatively the same now as before.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}: xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper_with_zeeman
	deals with the detailed handling of source function for Zeeman
	calculations
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Changed those mentioned in this now very long text.
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Added propmat_source_clearsky, src_xsec_per_species,
	src_coef, and src_coef_per_species.  Might have to update the text for
	these.
	
	* src/disort.cc,doit.cc,montecarlo.cc,rte.cc: 
	All have dummy propmat_source_clearsky variables for now.

2015-05-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-204

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): For abs_SpeciesSet, added
	"*abs_xsec_agenda_checked* and *propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked
	are set to be false." to on-line doc.

	* src/jacobian.cc (vmrunitscf):
	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoitAddSpecies):
	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw): Removed everything around
	logrel. This removes the logrel option from the standard
	jacobians. I also removed commented lines in the DOIT jacobians,
	to completly remove logrel from the code. To get a clean start if
	it will ever get back.

2015-05-22  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-203

	* src/m_jacobian.cc, methods.cc:
	Abandoned "logrel" perturbation option (back to "abs" and "rel" only as
	"rel" is very similar to "log" and "logrel" regarding the perturbation
	part).

2015-05-19 Simon Pfreundschuh <simonpf@student.chalmers.se>
	* arts-2-3-202

	Implemented multiplication using BLAS.

	* src/blas.h
	Added a header file for the declarations of the external BLAS functions.

	* src/CMakeLists
	Linked matpack library to BLAS library. The BLAS library is detected
	automatically or can be set using the BLASDIR variable.

	* src/matpackI.h
	Added mult_general method for the original multiplication
	implementation that works on all matrices.

	* src/matpackI.cc
	Implemented multiplication using the dgemm_ routine for matrix
	multiplication from the BLAS library.
	Renamed the original implementation to mult_general which is used
	as fallback if the matrix operands are not continuous.

	* src/test_matpack
	Added test case to test the new matrix multiplication implementation
	against the old.

	* src/test_oem
	Adapted benchmark_mult to benchmark both multiplication methods.

	* src/test_utils.*
	File that contains functions that are useful for testing, such as
	computation of errors and generation of random data.


2015-05-17  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-201

	* src/m_jacobian.cc, methods.cc:
	Changed DoitJacobian "logrel" option to use natural logarithm.
	Documentation adapted accordingly.

2015-05-17  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-200

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit):
	Added "logrel" perturbation option for abs_species and scat_species.
	Corrected perturbed field calc for "rel" option (now consistent with
	clearsky as x_pert=x_ref*(1.+dx) compared to x_pert=x_ref*dx before).

	* src/methods.cc: Moved a couple of WSM (which changed name in the
	recent past) into their supposed alphabetical order.

2015-05-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-199

	* src/m_sensor.cc (f_gridFromSensor{HIRS,AMSU}):

	Port Mathias' fix from arts-2.2 for inaccuracies in the frequency grid
	creation.

	* controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts:

	Compare result against reference calculation.

	* controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.NOAA14.ybatch.ref.xml: Added.
	
2015-05-11  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-198
	
	This update adds preliminary support for NLTE calculations.  I think
	that much of the code present will change a whole lot before the NLTE
	implementation is final but as far as I can tell at this point, it works.
	Still, consider this highly experimental code before you see a few more
	commits on this train of thought.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}: Moved remaining line strength scaling out of 
	xsec_single_line.  Some variable names might get updated here in the 
	future to reflect that the changes better.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}: This is where line strength scaling is now
	calculated in full.
	
	* src/linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.{cc,h}:  Added PF_Tv for vibrational
	temperature calculations.  Right now, this is an ugly implementation that
	requires input from ARTSCAT-5 of pressure grid, upper and lower energy 
	state and upper and lower energy state's vibrational temperatures.
	Note that negative vibrational temperatures are tagged as atmospheric 
	temperatures.  This part still requires a lot of work to be usable but
	it operates similar to expectations... for now.
	
	* CHANGES-2.3:  Added to ARTSCAT-5 that it does NLTE.  With warnings that
	it is not well-tested and that I need to do more work on this.

	Implemented linear OEM for data retrieval. Added randomized
	tests and benchmarks for OEM.

	Using the Matlab C++ interface, the tests use the OEM implementation in
	the atmlab package to validate the C++ implementation. I also implemented
	benchmarks in order to see how the C++ code performs. On my computer the
	C++ code was very slow, that means up to a factor of twenty slower.
	Since the linear OEM uses only matrix multiplication and inversion, it
	must be the primitive methods that are responsible for the bad performance.

	Maybe you could run the benchmarks on your machines. Since we want to use
	OEM with very large matrices, something must be done about this. I would
	propose to use LAPACK or something a similar library. LAPACK is built on
	BLAS whichs is also used by matlab as far as I know. The other possibility
	would be to optimize the existing code. I would like to hear your comments
	on that.

	To build the oem_test executable run
	cmake -DMATLABDIR=/path/to/your/MATLAB -DATMLABDIR=/path/to/your/atmlabx-x.x

	Running matlab from C++ also requires the c shell to be installed on your
	sysem.

	* src/oem.cc:
	The implementation of the linear OEM.

	* src/test_oem.cc:
	Tests and benchmarks for OEM. Starts a Matlab session and compares
	results and execution time to the OEM implementation in the atmlab
	package. Plots of the results are written to the test_oem_files folder
	in the binary folder.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt
	Added executable for oem tests including handling of the external
	dependencies on matlab and atmlab.

	* src/test_oem/test_mult.m
	Matlab script to benchmark matrix multiplication.

	* src/test_oem/test_inv.m
	Matlab script to benchmark matrix inversion.

	* src/test_oem/test_oem.m
	Matlab script to test linear oem inversion.

	* src/test_oem/linear_forward_model.m
	Matlab function representing a linear forward model.

	* src/test_oem/plot_script.m
	Matlab script to plot benchmark results.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianDoit):

	Fix critical bug: In the loop where the dydx result vector is
	calculated, the index was missing. Thus, instead of writing into the
	right position in dydx, the whole vector was overwritten with a
	constant value in every iteration. This resulted for, e.g., constant
	results for all frequencies. Bug reported by Verena and Freddy.

	* src/m_doit.cc b/src/m_doit.cc (DoitWriteIterationFields),
	src/methods.cc:

	Add generic input with frequency indexes. Adapt output filename to
	contain frequency index and iteration count. Avoids that iterations
	from different frequencies get overwritten. Changed value to select all
	frequencies / iterations from 0 to -1. Set default value for both.

	* CHANGES-2.3: Add changes from above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/doit_setup.arts:

	Adapt call of DoitWriteIterationFields.

	* src/m_doit.cc (DoitCalc): Reenable parallelization of frequency loop.

	Promoted several runtime_errors to ParseErrors to provide proper
	location information to the user.

	Better error message when default values in methods.cc for generic
	inputs contain errors.

	Dear all,

	This is my first commit. Maybe you could have a quick look whether
	the code is OK style-wise.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (lubacksub):
	Fixed potential bug in the handling of the pivot vector. The previous version
	deviated from the reference code in Numerical Recipes and produced incorrect
	results for certain row permutations.
	However, I am not quite sure whether the deviation from the reference
	implementation may have had a purpose, so maybe, Claudia, you could have a
	look at the code. The new code of course passes all relevant tests.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (inv):
	Implemented matrix inversion using LU decomposition

	* src/test_linalg.cc(test_solve_linear_system)
	Implemented randomized testing routing for the LU decomposition code, to
	make sure the code really produced incorrect results.

	* src/test_linalg.cc(test_inv)
	Randomized testing routing for matrix inversion.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex: In equation for r, it was only \pi, but
	should be \pi^2. Also added description of some more of the
	variables in these equations.

	* arts-2-3-189

	Everyone, I would like to hear your comments on the added documentation!

	* doc/uguide/absorption_theory.tex:  Added short text on Faddeeva
	function.  It lacks references at the moment.  At the end of line
	shape subsection, just before the partitoin function subsection.

	Added a short text on line mixing at the end of the spectroscopy section,
	just before the very short Zeeman effect entry.

	Added Artscat-5 line format table similar to Artscat-3 and Artscat-4.

	Added subsubsections on Artscat-5 pressure broadening and Artscat-5
	line mixing.  Both refer back to rpevious technical discussions.

	Key science question:  I have only ever looked properly and indepth 
	at molecular oxygen. O2 has no pressure shift.  When I designed water
	and air broadening, I added a self pressure shift parameter, mostly
	because it looks symmetric for all species to have the same parameters
	of their own.  Looking at the previous formats, such a parameter is 
	not present anywhere.  Is self pressure shift even possible or should 
	we remove the parameter before the format gets used more?
	
	Documentation structure question:  should we comment that PWR93
	line shapes are the imaginary part of the Lorentzian times the 
	first order line mixing correction plus the real part, or do you want 
	to leave the full model section as is for the future?
	
	Is anything unclear about the added documentation?
	
	* doc/uguide/references.bib:  Added a few references.  Should more be
	added?  Is any part under-referenced?

2015-03-30  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-188
	
	Structural changes to high level Artscat5 and to low level absorption 
	scheme.  Partition function is now calculated in a slightly altered
	manner.  This new way should make it much easier to add individual
	partitions to lines, making it cleaner to interact with low level
	abbsorption schemes.
	
	The work is mostly preparatory at this stage for the additions of 
	simple NLTE calculations within ARTS in the near future but is presently
	only capable of doing what has been done before with partition datan
	being built-in.  That said, the scheme already allows the user to specify 
	input an Artscat5 file with specialized coefficients for different 
	temperature schemes, making it useful for planetary applications when 
	todday's 150-350 K is not the best idea.
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt:  Added linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.cc.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Changed so partition function is calculated in
	linerecord_partitionfunctiondata rather than directly through abs_species.
	
	* src/linerecord.cc:  Added tag "PF" for partition function data from
	Artscat5 file format.  This acts similarly to "LM" and "QN" and "PB".
	FIXME: Not certain about the write-back to XML file feature.
	Finally added GetPartitionFunctionData through which partition is 
	calculated.
	
	* src/linerecord.h:  Includes linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.h and 
	has a PartitionFunctionData variable with a few methods of interaction
	similar to how LineMixingData works.
	
	*  src/linerecord_partitionfunctiondata.{h,cc}:  Added.  Deals with
	partition function data per line.  Defaults to built-in when no data is given.
	Note that it can presently only do exactly what built in is doing with coefficients
	and nothing more.  The structure is so that it should be clean to extend this in
	the future.  I am presently waiting for NLTE data where a pressure grid is gridded
	to a vibrational temperature.  This will be added when the data is understood.

	* arts-2-3-177
	
	* src/cia.{cc,h}:  Added append CIARecord functionality to CIARecord.
	
	* src/m_cia.cc: Added direct reading of individual CIARecord HITRAN
	file function. Added Append abs_cia_data with CIARecord functionality.
	Added Clobber abs_cia_data with CIARecord functionality. All just
	copy-paste of previously internal functions. Usecase: We want to change
	between CIA models to allow He-H2 and H2-H2 below 600 GHz for JUICE SWI
	comparison. HITRAN provides two separate models. Original CIA is only
	for above 600 GHz.
	
	Testing required. By reading arts-xml-data CIA file, printing it,
	clobbing it with below 600 GHz data, printing the changed abs_cia_data,
	then reclobbing with above 600 GHz model, and printing again. Output in
	the end is not identical to as before.
	
	Consider this a beta run.

	the doit_mono_agenda now, after DoitGetIncoming.

	(doit_i_field_monoSetConst):

	Renamed from doit_i_fieldSetConst. Although initialization should be
	done now outside of the doit_mono_agenda, I left this method in because
	it can be useful for testing.

	(doit_i_fieldSetConst):

	Added. Internally uses doit_i_field_monoSetConst to set the whole

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldXX): Corrected a couple of error messages.

	* src/m_checked.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Added consitency check of
	scat_species and scat_data sizes. We can not just rely on
	ScatteringParticlesSelect for that as ScatteringParticlesSelect is not

	here (previously provided by scat_i_p; now this info is directly put
	into doit_i_field by DoitGetIncoming).

	(DoitInit): Removed obsolete initialization variables.

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted to changes above. Removed any	references to
	doit_i_field1D_spectrum.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed doit_i_field1D_spectrum. Added docstring to
	all agenda definitions (refering to agendas.cc in online-doc is ugly.
	the general user shouldn't be pointed to source code.).

	Added rain to considered scat_species. In order to test non-zero setting
	for other than scat_species_mass_density_field fields. yref data adapted
	accordingly.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITFromIndividualFields.arts:
	Added. A test/demo case for cloudy calcs with pnd_field from hydrometeor
	profiles from non-compact atmosphere.
	The setup is a bit complicated. In future, I might add cloud-equivalents
	to AtmRawRead and AtmFieldsCalc. But for now this is sufficient, I think.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Above test case added.

	* controlfiles/testdata/chevallierl91_all_extract_wbackground_scenario0.*.xml:
	Added. A one-file-per-component atmosphere with hydrometeor profiles
	used in test case above. Scenario is taken from (hence identical to) the
	0.th case in chevallierl91_all_extract.xml with N2 and O2 added.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITprecalcInit.arts:

	Revert the comparison precision back to 2e-1 after discussion with

	field the calculation still converges to the "same" result. Just with
	more iterations. Therefore it should not fail when commenting out
	setting the initial field.

	(AtmFieldsRefinePgrid): Use AtmFieldPRegrid for z_field, t_field, and
	vmr_field regridding.

	(p_gridDensify): Modify behaviour to be consistent with p_gridRefine
	assuming we modify an in-use p_grid, i.e. set the respective check
	variables to 0 (unchecked) and do not allow to overwrite p_grid in
	place, but keep the old p_prid.

	(p_gridRefine): Use some log10->ln conversion of p_step as in
	abs_lookupSetup.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Compare): Added variant for Tensor4.

	* src/methods.cc: Modified according to changes above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/regrid/TestRegridFields.arts:

	variables scat_i_* and doit_i_field1D_spectrum.

	* CHANGES-2.3: List changes that need controlfiles to be adapted.

	* src/methods.cc, src/doit.cc, src/m_doit.cc:

	Remove obsolete scat_i_* and doit_i_field1D_spectrum variables and
	replace them with doit_i_field/doit_i_field_mono in all DOIT methods.

	(doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum):

	Replace doit_i_field1D_spectrum by generic input Tensor7
	doit_i_field_spectrum. (Temporary fix, this method will be changed
	further soon)

	(DoitCloudboxFieldPut): Removed. Not needed anymore.

	Remove scat_i_p and doit_i_field1D_spectrum.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/doit_setup.arts,

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Remove paragraph about scat_i_* WSVs.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/doit_i_fieldREFERENCE_DOIT.xml:
	
	Renamed from doit_i_field1D_spectrumREFERENCE_DOIT.xml and changed to
	Tensor7 by adding the missing dimensions with size 1 without touching
	the original values.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/disort/TestDISORT.arts:

	unphysical values for propagation close to the horizon, here
	emissivity and reflectivity can be outside [0,1]. Now, if either
	emissivity or reflectivity is below/above 0/1, it is set to
	0/1, and the other value is set to 1/0. That is, e+r=1 is
	enforced. These problems start about 15 degrees from the

	* src/agendas.cc, src/doit.{cc,h}, src/m_doit.cc, src/methods.cc,
	src/workspace.cc:

	Change doit_i_field from Tensor6 to Tensor7.

	Add WSV doit_i_field_mono. This replaces doit_i_field in all internal
	DOIT methods whereas doit_i_field is output of DoitCalc.
	Also rename doit_i_field_old to doit_i_field_old_mono.

	* Cleanup of initialization of DOIT WSVs before starting work
	on doit_i_field changes.

	* src/m_doit.cc:

	(DoitInit): Add initialization of scat_i_* for 3D. Introduce some
	helper variables for frequently used dimension sizes for readability.

	(DoitCloudboxFieldPut, DoitGetIncoming, DoitGetIncoming1DAtm):

	Remove resizing of scat_i_*, it's now in DoitInit.

	(doit_i_fieldSetClearsky, doit_i_fieldSetConst,
	doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum):
	Remove doit_i_field resizing, because it is already done in DoitInit.

	* src/methods.cc:

	Change variables that are initialized in DoitInit and were defined as
	output-only in DoitCalc, DoitCloudboxFieldPut, doit_i_fieldSetConst,
	doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum and DoitGetIncoming to
	input+output. Otherwise their initialization in DoitInit
	has no effect. Output-only variables are resized to 0 before they're
	passed to a workspace method.  The code worked anyway because they were
	resized again in the respective functions.

	* arts-2-3-136

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc_mblock_loop_body): Now probing the H matrix
	to find boresight directions by Stokes vectors = [1 0 0 0], which
	is obviuosly the right thing to do. Before [1 1 1 1] was applied
	and this caused failures in some cases with sensor rotation.

2015-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-135

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_mhs.arts:
	Removed ; after last line in antenna_dlos. Existing settings
	caused an error as band touched at LO. Changed these band to have
	0 offset and doubled bandwidth, following the treatment of e.g.
	channel 15 of AMSU-A.

	* src/sensor.cc (met_mm_polarisation_hmatrix): Changed to take dza
	as input. This as the rotation depends on the angle with respect
	to the platform reference direction, and not absolute za.

	The sign of the rotation angle is so far just a guess, for all
	instruments. The sign does not matter as long as U=0.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM): Adopted call of
	met_mm_polarisation_hmatrix.

	* AgendaExecute bug fix part 3/2. ;-)

	* src/agenda_class.cc:

	(Agenda::is_input): The check for WSVs used as inputs by agendas passed
	as generic inputs was overly ambitious. A recursive check of the
	methods inside the agenda is not needed. It actually causes false
	errors depending on the order of initialization of agendas. Only the
	interface variables of the agenda should be checked.
	Fixes bug reported by Patrick.

	(Agenda::set_outputs_to_push_and_dup): Instead of having one special
	case for the output variables of AgendaExecute, treat all Agendas
	passed as generic input the same way.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/agendas/TestAgendaExecute.arts:

	Added test case for agenda scoping.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldMGD_LWC, pnd_fieldMGD_IWC):

2015-01-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-131

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM): Softened the
	demand of za in sensor_los. This angle can now be inside
	[160,180], to allow some handling of cases where the central
	position of the scanning is not a at nadir, due to non-nominal
	pitch and roll. This solution should be sufficient for 1D. For 3D,
	a total general treatment of pitch+roll would require more
	variables. The present solution is only totally accurate when the
	scan centre position has moved exactly in the direction of the
	corresponding azimuth angle. If the scan centre position is at
	some other azimuth, you simulation will be performed an OK zenith
	angle, but the azimuth will be wrong. This also means that the
	geo-positioning will be incorrect.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Added if (failed) continue before calling
	geo_pos_agenda. The call of geo_pos_agenda should probably be
	inside a try/catch.

2015-01-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-130

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM): stokes_dim > 1
	again accepted. Seems to work, but there is a big potential for
	problems here. As it is now, iy_unit must be set to its final
	value before calling this WSM. If it is reset afterwards, there
	could be an error of a factor 2. This is associated with
	calibration and all this needs a revision! Leave as it is for the
	moment.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Used ws instead of l_ws when calling
	geo_pos_agenda, that caused intermittent failures.

2015-01-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	If the Agenda contains an AgendaExecute call, also collect the outputs
	of that agenda for proper scoping.

	(Agenda::is_input): Cosmetics. Use WsvGroupMap to find the Agenda index.

	* src/m_agenda.cc (AgendaExecuteExclusive): Call AgendaExecute.

2015-01-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-128

	AgendaExecute bug fix part 1/2

	* src/m_agenda.cc (AgendaExecute):

	Partial fix for severe bug in AgendaExecute. It did not apply any
	scoping. This means that all workspace variables that were modified
	in the executed agenda were leaked into the global scope. Now only
	variables explicitly defined as output are passed back (but still leak
	into global scope, will be fixed in part 2).

	* src/agenda_class.{cc,h} (find_unused_variables):

	Remove unused function.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_amsua.arts:

	Remove duplicate met_mm_polarisation initialization. Thanks Alex!

	* arts-2-3-127

	* A system to geo-position the data in place, but should for
	the moment just be seen as a test feature. Anyhow:

	Adding geo-positioning is achived by setting geo_pos_agenda. For a
	downward-looking operational sensors, this should be the standard
	choice:

	AgendaSet( geo_pos_agenda ){
	  geo_posEndOfPpath
	}

	The final geo-pos is returned as y_geo. Works for all
	atmosphere_dim, but of course most useful for 3D.

	Commemnts: There is no actual description of the bore-sight for
	calculations with antenna. The bore-sight is instead determined by
	probing the sensor response matrix, which results in a bit of
	calculation burden to achieve the geo-positioning. How well this
	works for cases with an antenna pattern applied has not yet
	tested.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (geo_posEndOfPpath,geo_posLowestAltitudeOfPpath):
	The new WSMs, to be used inside geo_pos_agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Added definition of
	geo_pos_agenda. This version set geo_pos to be empty.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianCalcAbsSpeciesPerturbations)
	(jacobianCalcPointingZaRecalc)
	(jacobianCalcTemperaturePerturbations): Added geo_pos_agenda and
	adopted call of iyb_calc.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Added geo_pos_agenda. It is here that it
	is actually called.
	(iyb_calc_body): Added ppath as output argument.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalcAppend, yCalc): Added geo_pos_agenda and

	* src/parser.{cc,h}:

	Throw runtime error if a ...Create WSM is called inside an agenda. This
	is to avoid confusion how variables are working in ARTS. WSVs are
	always global, even if they were created inside an agenda. Therefore
	defining two agendas that create the same variable (even if they are
	never executed) will throw an error that the variable already exists.
	It's therefore better to only allow Create being called inside the
	global scope where it actually creates the variables in.

	The MetMM part now throws an error if stokes_dim > 1, as the
	results are worng (probably just a factor of 2 to fix).

	* src/m_jacobian.cc: Adopted all calls of iyb_calc.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Added handling of geo_pos.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc, yCalcAppend): Added handling of y_geo, here
	and in sub-functions.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added geo_pos_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added geo_pos and y_geo.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Removed some outdated comments.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM):  The mirror_dza
	feature now working. Noticed that results incorrect for
	stokes_dim > 1. Not yet solved and just added an error if used.

2015-01-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-124

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM): Expanded built.in
	do text. Added checks of input. For example, za in sensor_los must
	now be 180 deg. Started to work on simpler handling of 3D.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts: The settings
	removed below are now found here.

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/sensor_amsub.arts:
	Removed setting of sensor_pos and sensor_los.

	* src/ppath.cc (map_daa): The aa_grid value was limited to [-5,5].
	Don't understand why; the algorithm should work for any angle. Now
	limited to [-180,180].

2015-01-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-123

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm:

	Created directory for new sensor setups.

	The proposed subdirectory structure is:

	metmm/sensor_descriptions/
	metmm/test_cases/
	metmm/clearsky_batch/
	metmm/cloudy_batch/
	metmm/spectroscopy/
	metmm/zeeman/

	* controlfiles/instruments/metmm/sensor_descriptions/
	{sensor_amsua.arts, sensor_amsub.arts, sensor_deimos.arts,
	sensor_ismar.arts, sensor_marss.arts, sensor_mhs.arts}:

	Added sensor descriptions for AMSU-A, AMSU-B, MHS, ISMAR, DEIMOS,
	MARSS. TODO: Add viewing angles for I, D and M. Add HIRS, AVHRR...

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts:

	Adapted to use the new sensor description. Also shows how to select
	a subset of channels and viewing angles for the calculation.

	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs.sensor_los.xml:

	Corrected viewing angles for MHS. They were the same as AMSU-B, but
	they are actually slightly different.

2015-01-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-122

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM), methods.cc:

	Turn freq_spacing into a Vector to behave the same as freq_number.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSUB_MetMM.arts: Adapted.

2015-01-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-121

	* src/m_select.h, src/methods.cc:

	Add [-1] as special case for needleindexes to select all elements.
	Throw runtime error instead of asserting if needleindexes contains
	negative elements (except for the special case of course).

2015-01-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-120

	* Many changes around the files. Not all details written down. The
	overall aim was to increase the flexibility and consistency of how
	LOS values are handled. A main driver was to go away from a
	rectangular mblock za-aa grid.

	All tests run (including test on uguide!), but there could still
	be bugs from all these changes. Tell me if you get strange
	results.

	Most changes should not affect standard usage. The most noticable
	changes are:

	* mblock_za_grid is now renamed to mblock_dlos_grid and is now a
	matrix. As long as 1D antennas are used, all you need is to convert
	mblock_za_grid to a single column matrix.

	* AntennaSet1D is removed. Replace this WSM with
	IndexSet(antenna_dim,1).

	* src/(agendas.cc m_checked.cc m_jacobian.cc m_rte.cc m_sensor.cc
	methods.cc rte.cc rte.h sensor.cc sensor.h workspace.cc): Affected
	source files.

	* controlfiles/../(TestFgrid.arts TestGbased.arts
	TestRteCalcMC.arts TestStokesRotation.arts TestWfuns.arts
	amsub_metmm.arts odinsmr_501.arts odinsmr_501_1D.arts
	odinsmr_544.arts): Affected control files.

	* doc/uguide: Updated email address for Stefan in start pages of
	the docs. Updated copyright years. Fixed references to renamed WSV
	and WSM. Mainly the ones listed below, but also some on the
	scattering side.

	* Renamed + modified WSVs:
	antenna_los             -> antenna_dlos
	mblock_za_grid          -> mblock_dlos_grid
	sensor_response_za_grid -> sensor_response_dlos_grid
	sensor_response_za      -> sensor_response_dlos

	Removed WSVs:
	mblock_aa_grid
	sensor_response_aa_grid
	sensor_response_aa

	Modified WSVs:
	stokes_rotation is now a vector (before a matrix)

	* src/m_sensor.cc (AntennaSet1D,AntennaSet2D): Removed. Now just
	setting antenna_dim=1/2.

2015-01-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-119

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts: Now using
	antenna_los.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM): atmosphere_dim
	now checked, and only 1D allowed at this point. The set of input
	relative angles now specified by antenna_los. mblock_za_grid now
	only output. This for better consistency with other sensor methods.

2015-01-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-118

	* Contrary to what I wrote in an email to the arts mailing lists,
	surface_rtprop_agenda must stay as it is used of MC and DOIT. To
	allow combining the surface type system and MC/DOIT, this means
	that I instead had to introduce the surface_rtprop_sub_agenda
	series, to have one such agenda for each iy_surface_sub_agendaX.

	iy_surface_agenda and surface_rtprop_agenda remain unchanged and
	you can use these two agendas exactly as before. The corresponding
	agenda seriers are just needed if you want to operate with surface
	types.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface_sub.arts: Dummy definition
	of the new agenda series. No need to include this file for
	standard calculations.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceCallSubAgendaX): Renamed, and now
	handling X = 0 to 5. That also means that all those agendas must
	be defined.

	(surface_rtpropCallSubAgendaX): New WSM.

	* src/agendas.cc: The set of surface type agendas are now called
	iy_surface_sub_agendaX, where X is 0 to 5. Also introduced a
	parallel set of agendas: surface_rtprop_sub_agendaX.

2015-01-15  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-118

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc, methods.cc
	(p_gridRefine): Added. WSM to calculate refined p_grid with log10
	spacings of p below a given threshold. Mimicking the creation of a finer
	grid as done in AtmFieldsRefinePgrid (including fix to use p_step indeed
	for log10 spacings as said in doc, not for ln spacings).

	(AtmFieldsRefinePgrid): Apply new WSM p_gridRefine for fine p_grid
	creation.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/regrid/TestRegridFields.arts,
	TestRegridFields.odepth_refineREFERENCE.xml,
	TestRegridFields.y_refineREFERENCE.xml,
	controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Added test case for regridding of atmospheric fields (Tensor data
	level).

	* src/workspace.cc (cloudbox_checked): Updated obsolete reference to
	*basics_checked*.

2015-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-117

	* src/m_surface.cc (FastemStandAlone): Upper limit of frequency

	* arts-2-3-115

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum):
	Remove the next freshly introduced bug *sigh*.

2015-01-14  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-114

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITprecalcInit.arts:
	Use correct DOIT initial guess input file.

2015-01-14  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-114

	* Bugfix in first-guess DOIT field setting: the radiation incident on
	the cloudbox boundaries shall not be set from the first guess, but from
	the (potentially modified) clearsky incoming field.

	* src/m_doit.cc, methods.cc (doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum):
	After setting doit_i_field from doit_i_field1D_spectrum, update the
	incoming radiation streams on the boundaries according to scat_i_p/lat/lon
	(precalculated! use e.g. DoitGetIncoming).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOITprecalcInit.arts:
	Add call of DoitGetIncoming to derive scat_i_p/lat/lon now also required
	for non-clear initial guess from doit_i_fieldSetFromdoit_i_field1D_spectrum.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.doit_i_field1D_spectrum.xml:
	Removed. Last re-added data was wrong. Also, bad idea to use a TestDOIT
	dependent, constantly rewritten file as reference/starting point for
	TestDOITprecalcInit.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/doit_i_field1D_spectrumREFERENCE_DOIT.xml:
	Added. New i_field data (taken from from TestDOIT, not to be overwritten
	in future) as initial guess input to TestDOITprecalcInit.

2015-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-113

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: Now using

	now in iy_surface_agenda.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added surface_type[2,5]_agenda.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda): New WSM.

	(surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity): Changed, stokes_dim-s higher than
	1 are now also allowed.

2015-01-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-112

	* Implemented handling of different surface types, including
	selection from predefined mask.

	* src/agendas.cc: Introduced surface_type0_agenda and
	surface_type1_agenda. Will add more when more testing as been
	made.

	* src/workspace.cc: Introduced surface_type, surface_type_aux and
	surface_type_mask.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_typeInterpTypeMask): New WSM.
	(iyFromSelectedSurfaceTypeAgenda): New WSM.

2015-01-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-111

	* src/workspace.cc: Corrected unit string for
	scat_species_mass_density_field.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iyWaterSurfaceFastem): Stupid typo among
	intial input checks. Had to introduce sensor_los_dummy. rtp_los
	was used beofre, but telescoping for 3D cases gives wrong
	dimension for resulting matrix.

2015-01-13  Manfred Brath  <manfred.brath@uni-hamburg.de>

	* arts-2-3-110

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Corrected the last paragraph in the

	* src/absorption.cc:  Removed old header information.

	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.cc: Fixed fatal bug in how self
	broadening was stored and read in my implementation for ARTSCAT-5.

	* src/linemixingdata.{cc,h}: Added explicit 1st order line mixing
	functionality. This was technologically possible with 2nd order
	line mixing, but it was confusing to read and understand.

2015-01-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-105

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): iy_aux now also considered
	even if iy_agenda_call1==0. A bit of overhead in the general case,
	but handy in some cases. For example, totally needed to handle
	FASTEM in an efficient manner.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iyWaterSurfaceFastem): Some simple tests done
	and the method seems to work.

2015-01-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-104

	* src/m_surface.cc (iyWaterSurfaceFastem): New WSM. Complete but

	(FastemStandAlone): Better documentation. Transmittance now also vector.

	* src/surface.cc (surface_calc): Moved from rte.cc.

	* src/fastem.cc: Extended header text. Za is now expected to be

	* src/fastem.h: Removed default for FASTEM version. This will be
	controlled by setting in methods.cc.

	* arts-2-3-100

	This updates clears some technological debts in how linemixing was
	dealt with in a completely different manner than pressure
	broadening, yet their data structures are similar. Still a debt
	left with non-resonant O2, which is treated as linemixing because
	the mathematics is so very similar but requires a specialized line
	shape function to operate properly.

	* src/absortprion.cc:  All specialized line mixing xsec functions
	have been removed and are now part of linemixingdata.{cc,h} and
	the wrapper function.

	* src/linemixingdata.{cc,h}:  Now has a generic "GetData" functionality.

	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.cc:  Just a tiny bit of tidying up.

	This update fixes a bug with line mixing lblrtm at high temperatures
	found from looking at artscat5 output.

	Conversion from artscat3 to artscat5 more consistent though not perfect.
	
	Water and air pressure broadening scheme added.  
	Promted due to finding:
	"Pressure broadening of oxygen fine structure lines by water" in JQSRT Volume 154, 
	March 2015, Pages 24–27.
	
	Tried for molecular oxygen at 118 GHz between 113 and 121 GHz with 5x 
	subarctic-summer water content.	Results on initial trial gives difference 
	to air broadening scheme of upwards 0.7 K for ground-based and as low as 
	0.01 K for satellite-based platforms in this frequency range. Note that
	the paper gives two values for water pressure broadening found using different 
	spectroscopic techniques.  The least broadening had a factor ~3 less difference
	with air broadening scheme as the values above
	
	
	* src/absorption.cc: Using a routine to find the water index in abs_species.
	Passing this along to pressure broadening.
	
	* src/linemixingdata.h:  Minor formatting.
	
	* src/linerecord.*,m_abs.cc:  Fixed bug on reading line mixing parameters at high
	temperatures. Fixed error in conversion from artscat3 to artscat5.  artscat5 is identical
	to artscat3 given the right pressure broadening definition, but before artscat3to4
	was used as a layer.  Found that this fix removed strangeness in reading lines
	from external, storing lines, then rereading lines from artscat5.  Now 
	just reading lines from external is more close to the previous scheme, but some
	cases it still produce strangeness (though at numerical drift levels of uncertainity).
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.*:  Added a water and air pressure broadening scheme.
	This assumes air pressure is pressure-self_pressure-water pressure for non-water
	species then copies the simple air broadening scheme for the rest.  This method is
	used only if artscat5 pressure broadening scheme tag is "WA", and expects a bit different
	variables than simple air broadening.  No data error is stored, contrary to how air is
	dealt with.  Proper documentation pending on time.

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat5Stream, operator<<):

	Don't store the number of elements for pressure broading and linemixing
	inside the catalog. Use the ExpectedVectorLengthFromType instead.

2014-12-17  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-97
	
	Added lm_p_lim as a limit to pressure for line mixing. Default is 0.
	This is because I encountered a problem with lblrtm line mixing
	temperature grid at high altitude, where atmospheric temeprature is low.
	Opted for workspace variable instead of linemixing variable by advice
	from Oliver.  The other options were to make it part of abs_species 
	or store limit per line, one of which is confusing, the other of which
	is a waste of space.
	
	* src/linemixingdata*: Changed so that each function that deals with line
	mixing accepts pressure and pressure limit.  If pressure is lower than
	pressure limit, then the line mixing output is set to zero, essentailly
	ignoring it.
	
	* the rest:  passing lm_p_lim to the right position.

	Use double_imanip for parsing floating point numbers. Otherwise breaks
	using the failbit for error detection in gcc. Contrary to clang, gcc
	sets the failbit to true if it encounters a NaN value.

	(operator<<): Don't write Sgam separately into ARTSCAT-5. It is part of the

	reach the upper limit by chance which then results in a frustrating
	crash.

2014-12-03  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-80

	* src/linerecord.h:

	Add ma, mgupper and mglower to element initialization list in

2014-11-28  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-76

	* Modifications to allow DOIT's first guess doit_i_field to be set from
	precalculated doit_i_field1D_spectrum (instead of from clearsky).
	To be backported to ARTS-2.2.

	* src/m_doit.cc
	(doit_i_fieldSetFromDoit_i_field1D_spectrum): Added. Method to set
	first make arts guess doit_i_field from precalculated full
	spectrum field doit_i_field1D_spectrum (e.g. from a similar, but
	not identical atmospheric scenario). Note, works for 1D only.
	Currently a very basic versions that requires the precalculated
	field to be on same grids
	(freq, atm levels, angles) as the current calculation, i.e. no
	interpolation. In future, atm level and angle grid interpolation
	could/should be allowed.

	(DoitCloudboxFieldPut): Don't resize and zero doit_i_field1D_spectrum.
	It has been initialized by DoitInit already. However, for atm_dim=1
	always set it from doit_i_field, not only when sensor inside cloudbox
	(we might want to output it for later use/analysis).

	(ScatteringDoit): Don't zero-size doit_i_field1D_spectrum before
	entering doit_mono_agenda. It might contain data we want to use inside
	the agenda.

	(DoitInit): Initialize, i.e. properly size and set to zero,
	scat_i_p/lat/lon and doit_i_field1D_spectrum. Needed as either group of
	them can be used to set the first guess doit_i_field, meaning that the
	other group usually remains uninitialized otherwise. Note, this change
	requuires DoitInit to be called BEFORE any other WSM setting input for
	ScatteringDoit like CloudboxGetIncoming (else the data will be erased
	again)..

	* src/methods.cc: Adapt to changes of WSMs above.

	* src/agendas.cc (doit_mon_agenda):
	Added doit_i_field1D_spectrum as input.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts,
	doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	Move DoitInit call to before CloudboxGetIncoming, adopting to DoitInit
	changes above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestAbs.arts, TestAbsDoppler.arts:
	Replaced references to obsolete abs_coefCalc.

	* a couple of WSM for analysis of PSD data.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pndFromdNdD):
	Method to convert dNdD to pnd, i.e. size bin integrated number
	densities. Mimics what is happening inside pnd_fieldSetup.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ExtractFromMetaSingleScatSpecies):
	Method to extract parameters from meta data structure.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (VectorVectorMultiply):
	Method for element-wise multiplication of 2 vectors.

	* src/methods.cc:
	Definition and doc of the above new WSM.

2014-11-22  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-72

	* Changed approach of handling compact and batch scenarios. Now allows
	the compact batch (ArrayOfGriddedField4) to be the basic data type, not
	anymore the ArrayOfMatrix.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc
	(AtmFieldsFromCompact): Revised atm_fields_compact to *_fields
	conversion, selection approach. No more constraints on order of fields.
	All matching/selection done based on field name tags.
	Cleaner handling of scattering species data fields. They are now sorted
	into data fields depending on their type - no mixing of mass densities
	and fluxes, etc. anymore.
	(AtmFieldsExpand1D): Allow switching off rejection of fields with NaN
	values. Need that to be able to expand the scat_species_*_*_field when
	converting to 3D atmosphere.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupSetupBatch): Revised to work with new
	batch_atm_fields_compact definition (e.g. consider fields are not
	sorted).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxSetAutomatically):
	Consider all scat_species_*_*_fields, not just mass_density. Improved
	efficiency of cloudbox limits search. Ensure, it's only run for 1D,
	throwing an error for higher dims.

	(pnd_fieldSetup): For MP48, pass mass_flux field.

	* src/check_input.[cc,h] (chk_atm_field):
	Keyword to switch off NaN rejection.

	* cloudbox.[cc,h] (chk_scat_species_field):
	Consider NaN as a non-set value that doesn't trigger the cloudbox,
	equivalently to zero values.

	(pnd_fieldMH97, pnd_fieldH11, pnd_fieldH13, pnd_fieldH13Shape,
	pnd_fieldH98, pnd_fieldMP48):
	Proper error check, ensuring whatever field is needed by the PSD is
	present, i.e. has a non-NaN value. For PSD with PSD shape being a
	function of mass content or flux, disallow negative mass content/flux
	values; Ok for PSD, where mass content/flux only scales the pnd.

	(parse_atmcompact_speciestype, parse_atmcompact_speciesname,
	parse_atmcompact_scattype):
	Added methods to parse field name tags of compact atmospheres.

	* src/workspace.cc, methods.cc:
	Revised and updated documentation of all compact atmosphere related WSV
	and WSM. Adapted doc to further changes above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/ici/TestICI_fast.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSU_MetMM_generic.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSU_generic.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/mhs/TestMHS_generic.arts:
	Adapted batch_atm_fields_compact field_names to new convention.

2014-11-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-71

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_sensor.cc:

	(sensor_responseBackendMetMM):

	Remove use_polarisation input. stokes_dim is used to determine whether
	or not to calculate polarisation.

	Add mblock_za_grid as input.

	sensor_los contains now the nadir zenith angle direction of the sensor
	(e.g. 180 for AMSU). And mblock_za_grid the off-nadir scan angles.

	For each looking angle a measurement block is now used.

	* src/sensor.cc (met_mm_polarisation_hmatrix):

	Fix bug in if/elseif.

	Add doxygen documentation.

	* src/workspace.cc: Add polarisation docs to met_mm_polarisation.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.arts: Use lines based on hitran12 catalog.
	
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.hitran12_o3_lines.xml.gz:

	Extracted from hitran12. Also vastly reduce catalog size by only including
	O3 lines instead of all species.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSUB.ybatch.ref.xml:

	Updated based on calculation with hitran12 lines.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts:

	Use mblock_za_grid for scan angles.

	Add channel polarisation settings.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSUB_MetMM.arts:

	Include new TestAMSU_MetMM_generic.arts.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSU_MetMM_generic.arts:

	Based on TestAMSU_generic. Removed sensor_los because it can't be
	changed here anymore. It has to be set before the sensor setup because
	sensor_response now contains scan angle dependent polarisation information.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.mblock_za_grid.xml:

	Added. AMSU-B scan angles.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Add TestAMSUB_MetMM.

2014-11-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-70

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Added a check of obtained
	ppath to catch infinite loops at the surface. This could happen if
	you set (or as we did disturb) specular_los in an incorrect way,
	or potentially also happen due limited numerical accuarcy.

2014-11-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-69

	* src/surface.cc (surface_specular_R_and_b): surface_rmatrix(3,2)

	This commit fixes a strangeness found in the quadratic normalisation.
	Warning: it breaks controlfiles for clarity.

	* constrolfiles/instruments/odinsmr/odinsmr.arts:  Changes reflect above.

	* src/absorption.cc{cc,h}  Removed quadratic lineshape normalization test.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  moved hv/2kT/sinh(hv/2kT) into the normalisation
	routine.  Changed name of routine to “Rosenkranz_quadratic” to reflect
	what was going on inside absorption.cc before this commit.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Updated documentation to properly reflect new and old
	behaviour for quadratic normalisation.

2014-11-11  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-67
	
	Restructuring of pressure broadening in preparation for ARTSCAT-5 format.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  These files were restructured to reflect changes
	below.
	
	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:  The linerecord no longer contains an assortment of
	pressure broadening parameters but a single pressurebroadeningdata class.
	This is reflected in how the reading routines handle pressure data.  There are
	adaptions to all the relevant previous calls to return individual line parameters
	inside the pressure broadening class.

	One
	important design decision is that we no longer allow internally different
	temperatures for line parameters and pressure parameters.  All old formats
	that allowed this have been adapted to store pressure broadening internally
	at the appropriate temperature by (T0/T1)^n conversion for gamma and
	(T0/T1)^(.25+1.5n) for deltaf.
	
	* src/linemixingdata.{cc,h}:  restructured slightly to reflect design decisions
	in pressurebroadeningdata.
	
	* src/pressurebroadeningdata.{cc,h} (added):  This class contains a structure
	of data that is similar to the structures that previously were kept in linerecord.

	use it for other test cases, too.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestAbsParticle.arts:
	Adapted according to data moves above.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Added TestAbsParticle.arts to regular tests.

2014-11-10  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-65

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ParticleTypeAdd, ParticleType2abs_speciesAdd):
	Fixed for use with ArrayOfArray scat_data.

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyAddParticles):
	Fixed for use with ArrayOfArray scat_data. Don't silently assume there's
	only one scat species, instead allow scat_data to contain multiple.

	* src/methods.cc (ParticleType2abs_speciesAdd):
	More precise doc.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex:
	Revised absorbing-only particles section. Added reference to setup
	example.

	* doc/uguide/rte_basics.tex:
	Reworded 'Absorbing species and particles' to 'Absorbing species and
	scattering particles' in order to avoid misreading as
	'absorbing particles'.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestAbsParticle.arts:
	Added a test case for absorbing-only particles.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts:
	Modified to use two scattering elements instead of only one (that's
	better to detect bugs in handling ArrayOfArray and other non-1D
	elements).

2014-11-07  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-64

	* src/methods.cc (pnd_fieldSetup): Cleaned up documentation. Completed
	available distribution info.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldSetup): Add a reminder comment to update
	tag info in methods.cc whenever new distributions are added.

2014-11-03  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-63

	* src/absorption.cc:  Simplified so cutoff is not dependent on
	linemixing.  We (me and Manfred) found this produced most consistent
	results with AER's own simulations.  Note that line mixing will
	produce negative absorption at some frequencies in the present
	only option so zero forcing is required.

2014-10-30  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-62

	* src/methods.cc:  propmat_clearsky is now also input to the zero forcing
	function.

2014-10-30  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-61

	* src/{m_abs.cc,methods.cc}:  Added propmat_clearskyForceNegativeToZero,
	which force propmat_clearsky to zero if negative.  This seems necessary
	for CO2 line mixing from testing.

2014-10-30  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-60
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Fixed how line mixing deals with cutoff.
	Also added sec_species tests to wrapper.

2014-10-29  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-59
	
	* src/abs_species_tag.cc:  Removed tagging problems with line mixing.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Removed LineRecord dependency for internal-
	most loop of (xsec_species).  The function call inside to
	(xsec_single_line) now only depends on base variables.  The advantage
	is that neither Zeeman nor line mixing must copy LineRecords to work,
	reducing their slowest test case by a factor 3 in runtime for the 
	fastest setup requiring PreCalc.  (calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4)
	was changed to reflect previous behaviour.  There are some other small 
	changes inside (xsec_single_line) resulting in small gains but the 
	function call is complicated so the overall runtime running no Zeeman
	and no line mixing is slightly slower (less than 5%) in our test case.
	The old methods are still included in the function but there is no
	way to use them without altering code.  The speed increase is from
	accessing the absorption calculations from the wrappers instead of
	through xsec_species.  Line mixing is now done internally in 
	(xsec_singel_line) instead of in wrapper.
	
	* src/linerecord.h:  Can return artscat4 full vectors now.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc:  Fixed slight error in (faddeeva_algorithm_916)
	use of aux vector.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc:  Minor change in input to wrapper to work with above.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  PreCalc now only touch the LineRecord before 
	calculations.  The frequency shift is passed along to wrapper 
	before being applied to frequency input in (xsec_single_line).
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Changed LineRecord to not be an output of PreCalc.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}:  Zeeman wrapper now pass central frequency along
	for PreCalc and empty vector for level-by-level calculations.

	* arts-2-3-48

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: TestTMatrixSSD.arts removed.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrix.arts: Extended,
	now also testing scat_data_singleTmatrix,
	diameter_maxFromDiameter_volume_equ and
	diameter_volume_equFromDiameter_max.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrixSSD.arts: Removed.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (diameter_maxFromDiameter_volume_equ): New name
	of theis WSM. And now also returns maximum axial area.
	(diameter_volume_equFromDiameter_max): New name of this WSM.
	(scat_data_singleTmatrix): Now also setting single_meta_data.

	* src/methods.cc:
	* src/tmatrix.h:
	* src/tmatrix.cc:
	* src/m_tmatrix.cc: Changed "aspect ratio" to "axial ratio"
	throughout the code, to follow what seems to be the standard
	nomenclature. At least, this is the name used in
	Mishchenko&Travis, 1998.

2014-10-21  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-47

	* src/cloudbox.cc(pnd_field*): Ensure that meta data required by
	specific size distribution method is available for each individual
	scattering element, else throw error.

	* src/methods.cc, m_cloudbox.cc(dNdD_MH97, dNdD_MP48),
	cloudbox.cc(pnd_fieldMH97, pnd_fieldMP48, IWCtopnd_MH97, PRtopnd_MP48):
	Change from using volume equivalent diameter to mass equivalent
	diameter, Dmass, in MH97 and melted equivalent diameter, Dmelt, in MP48.
	MH97 according to definition in MH97 paper. For MP48 literature is not
	very clear. MP48 itself only discussed rain drops, but MP48 is
	widely used for precipitating hydrometeors in general, e.g. in RTTOV
	(see doherty07:_ice_amsu_b_qjrms). Literature is not clear though, what
	diameter to be used in case of frozen hydrometeors. Considering the
	measurement technique used by MP48 is seems most plausible to assume
	melted diameter.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.ybatch.ref.xml:
	Adjusted. Using Dmass instead of Dvol in MH97 causes small changes in
	BT due to slightly different assumption of ice density.

2014-10-21  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-46
	
	* controlfiles/*{zeeman,linemixing}*:  Fixed to reflect the changes.
	
	* src/absorption.cc:  Cutoff was implemented poorly for phase, and 
	the implementation does not work with line mixing at all.  Now, cutoff
	must be turned off for line mixing and Zeeman calculations to work.
	
	* src/rational.{h,cc}: Less Simplify() calls.
	
	* src/*zeeman.{h,cc}:  Small speed improvements moving variables around.
	Still a huge speed loss for copying inputs to speedy Zeeman case.

	Adapted to new fromat of scattering meta data. Cleaned up a little.

	(IWCtopnd_MH97, IWCtopnd_H11, IWCtopnd_H13, IWCtopnd_H13Shape,
	area_ratioH13, LWCtopnd, PRtopnd_MP48):
	Removed density from method interfaces. More consistent naming of method
	parameters.

	(chk_pndsum): Replace method input volume and density by mass.

	(scale_H11, scale_H13, parse_part_material): Removed obsolete methods.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc: Removed methods scat_metaAddTmatrix,
	scat_dataFromMeta, scat_metaAddTmatrixOldVersion. New meta data format
	does not support Tmatrix inpu anymore.

	* src/constants.cc: Density of water ice and liquid water added.

2014-10-15  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-3-42
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:   Created two new functions to calculate Zeeman
	effect a little bit different.  These new methods makes the Zeeman 
	test cases 10 to 25% faster, but should offer much larger speed
	improvements on higher p_grid:s.  
	
	The old Zeeman code still works as before but will be slower for
	magnetic fields that are exactly zero.  Documentation pending.
	
	Use (ZeemanLineRecordPreCalc) after the linerecords are finalized
	and change (propmat_clearskyAddZeeman) to
	(propmat_clearskyAddZeemanFromPreCalc) in the agenda to use the
	new method.
	
	* src/zeeman.{cc,h}: Incorporated linerecord creation in this
	file.
	
	* src/workspace.cc:  Added zeeman_linerecord_precalc.
	
	* {the rest}:  Controlfiles for test added; looks at the same
	comparison with both Zeeman methods.  Agenda call added to agendas.arts.
	Corresponding fixes in m_checked and methods.

	* src/quantum.{cc,h} (QuantumNumbers):

	Change QuantumContainer from std::map to Array. Speeds up the extensive
	zeeman test case by 1.5x on Linux and 2x on Mac. Even though the array
	now allocates space for all quantum numbers instead of just the ones
	that actually exist, early test have shown that it does not use more
	memory than the prior std::map implementation.

	* arts-2-3-40
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:   Starting modularization of code.

	recommended to use this line shape elsewhere, since it is custom made for 
	non-resonance.

2014-09-30  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-22

	* src/linerecord.cc:  Fixed so that Zeeman calculations for 
	molecular oxygen works with the LBLRTM catalog.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex:  Document changes in line mixing.

2014-09-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-21

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc:
	
	(SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag): Remove tag LM_2NDORDER. Instead a -LM flag
	should be placed after the species name (or the optional Z tag).

	(SpeciesTag::Name): Adapt for LM tag change.

	* src/methods.cc: Update docs for LM tag change.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/linemixing/TestLineMixing*.arts:

	Adapt for LM tag change.

2014-09-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-20

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper):

	Fix incorrect parenthesis.

2014-09-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* src/math_funcs.cc (unitl): 

2014-09-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-19

	* src/sensor.cc (met_mm_polarisation_hmatrix): Added rotation
	information for ISMAR. And on the same time rearranged the code
	and the notation, hopefully to make things clearer. 

2014-09-29  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-18

	Implementation of LBLRTM line mixing now works.  For O2,
	this produces less than 0.1 K difference with PWR98 in the
	band center, and about 0.5 K difference in the band wings.
	The test was done on straight-downward looking geometry across
	the 60 GHz band.

	* src/linemixingdata.{cc,h}:  Fixed interpolation scheme so that it
	does not crash at run.

	* src/linerecord.cc:  Fixed non-working test and error in conversion
	factor.

2014-09-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-17

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_dataTmatrix): Removed "From" from name
	and fixed typos in description.
	(ParticleDmaxFromDe, ParticleDeFromDmax): Also renamed, now using
	From instead of To, to have the output variable first in WSM name.

2014-09-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-16

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (ParticleDeToDmax, ParticleDmaxToDe): New. Not
	yet tested in detail.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_dataFromTmatrix): Write on-line doc for
	the WSM.
	(scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrixOldVersion): Removed.

	* src/optproperties.h:
	* src/cloudbox.cc (chk_scat_data):
	* src/optproperties.cc (ParticleTypeFromString)
	(ParticleTypeToString): Removed PARTICLE_TYPE_SPHERICAL. This
	ptype has not been implemented in any part.

2014-09-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-15

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_dataFromTmatrix): Missed that r, not d
	should be input to T-matrix. Now seems to match old
	implementation. Documentation not yet in place. And unsure about
	setting of ptype.

2014-09-26  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-3-14

	* controlfiles/instruments/ismar:
	Folder added for ISMAR setups (rather: all FAAM microwave radiometer,
	includes MARSS and Deimos).

	* controlfiles/instruments/ismar/marss.arts, deimos.arts, ismar.arts:
	Basic sensor description setups. So far contain only the
	sensor_description matrix (in amsu form. to be updated when new format
	is implemented.).

2014-09-26  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-13
	
	* src/absorption.{cc.h}:  Added functionality to deal with lines that
	are not mixed even though the species is mixed.  Also added LBLRTM
	mixing scheme.  This is still very much in testing.
	
	* src/linemixingdata.cc:  Added some more error checking.
	
	* src/m_conversion.h:  Added functionality to convert wavenumber units
	to frequency.  This makes testing CO2 line mixing data easier, since
	the units are usually in wavenumbers.  These are 
	(FrequencyFromCGSAngularWavenumber) and 
	(FrequencyFromCGSKayserWavenumber)
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Made access point to reading routine for LBLRTM data
	(abs_linesReadFromLBLRTM).

2014-09-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-3-12
	
	* src/methods.cc, src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseBackendMetMM):

	Work in progress commit for the new WSM to generate a sensor setup for
	meteorological millimeter instruments.

	* src/workspace.cc: Add met_mm_{antenna, backend, polarisation}.

	* src/sensor.{cc,h} (met_mm_polarisation_hmatrix):

	Added based on Patrick's Test example in m_general.cc.

	* src/parser.{cc,h}:
	(parse_intvector_from_string): Added.
	(ArtsParser::set_gin_to_default): Add support for ArrayOfIndex.

	* src/check_input.{cc,h} (chk_met_mm_backend): Added.

	* src/array.h (CmpArrayOfNumeric): Add helper class that can be used to
	apply a sort order of a ArrayOfNumeric to a Vector.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/TestAMSUB_MetMM.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_metmm.arts:

	Temporarily added for testing.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.arts:

	Store sensor_response for diagnostics.

2014-09-25  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-3-11
	
	Big changes in line mixing handling.  Now line mixing is part of
	the line instead of, as before, a lookup table.  View this update
	as first beta version of the new line mixing functionality that we are
	adding.
	
	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:  Removed old line mixing scheme.
	
	* src/CMakeLists.txt:  Added linemixingdata.cc
	
	* src/abs_species_tags.{cc,h}:  Changed line mixing from type to on/off
	switch.  Still work to be done here so that the abs_species tag is
	"LM" instead of "LM_2NDORDER" to trigger line mixing on switch.
	
	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:  Now interacts with LineMixingData whenever
	line mixing is active. (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) will now
	loop over all lines if the species is actively doing line mixing and
	then switch between line mixing calculations depending on the tag 
	of line mixing carried by the line.  Note that so far this has only
	been implemented for the old case of 2nd order line mixing, and that
	it is not fully representable of the physics because it ignores lines
	that are not line mixed.  This will change in the coming days/weeks.
	That is only (xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order) will work in this
	version.
	
	* src/linemixingdata.{h,cc}:  This contains the LineMixingData class,
	which is a part of all LineRecords since this version.  This class will
	handle all line mixing data, except the builtin, in ARTS.  It is 
	presently feature incomplete but performs on par with previous scheme.
	
	* src/linerecord.{h,cc}:  Fixed (ReadFromHitran2001Stream), which was 
	broken.  Also added (ReadFromLBLRTMStream) as a copy of the previous 
	function that can also read the LBLRTM line mixing catalog.  Also,
	LineRecord now contains the LineMixingData class.
	
	* src/m_abs.cc: Added (abs_linesReadFromLBLRTM).  Also fixed mentionings
	of previous line mixing scheme.
	
	* src/m_linemixing.cc:  The function (line_mixing_dataMatch) has been
	adapted to work with the new scheme.  This still requires a lot of
	clean-up.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  Is adapted for the new line mixing scheme.
	
	* src/methods.cc:  Is adapted for new scheme.  Old methods remains
	but are commented out.
	
	* src/workspace.cc:: Is adapted for new scheme.  Old variable remains
	but are commented out.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed WSVs mc_cloud_opt_path,
	mc_cloud_opt_path_error, mc_IWP and mc_IWP_error, as not now not
	used by any WSM. Just causing confusion to have them around.

2014-09-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-3-8

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex: Added a second chapter inside the

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCalc, yCalcAppend, yCalc, yCalc_mblock_loop_body):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yCloudRadar): Adopted to change of
	iy_main_agenda. iy_unit just added as input and passed on.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Removed m_doit2.cc.

	* src/m_doit2.cc: Removed from svn. Old stuff of new use anymore.

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming):
	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm): iy_unit now hard-coded
	to "1".

	* src/agendas.cc: Added iy_unit as input to iy_main_agenda,
	iy_sub_agenda and iy_surface_agenda.

2014-09-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-2-19

	* controlfiles/instruments/[ici,smr]/
	[ici,ciwsir,cloudice,iss-smr,jaxa-smr].sensor_response_f_fast.xml:
	Added. Data for sensor_response_f set such that y_f created on their
	basis can safely be used with yApplyUnit (essentially, square of channel
	frequency is sum over monochromatic frequencies times their weight
	associated with the respective channel). 

	* controlfiles/instruments/[ici,smr]/
	[ici,ciwsir,cloudice,iss-smr,jaxa-smr]_fast.arts:
	Read sensor_response_f with BT-conversion valid frequencies from file
	(overwrites sensor_response_f set from sensor_responseSimpleAMSU).

	* controlfiles/instruments/ici/*.*:
	Moved all ICI related data & controlfiles here (from instruments/smr/).

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Adapted to above move of ICI files.

	* controlfiles/instruments/smr/jaxa-smr*.*:
	Renamed smr*.* to jaxa-smr for better recognizability.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_h2oSet): Removed spurious cout.

2014-07-17  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-2-18

	* src/m_abs.cc(abs_h2oSet, abs_n2Set, abs_o2Set):
	Do not throw error if respective species (H2O, N2, O2) is not given.
	Instead set the abs_XX with a dummy, absence flagging value (-99).
	This to get rid of the requirement to always include H2O, N2, and O2
	when any continuum/full model is to be applied although for the specific
	continuum they might not be needed at all).

	* src/continua.cc (xsec_continuum_tag):
	Introduced checks for valid abs_n2/o2/h2o for the specific continua that
	require those variables. Throw proper error message indicating the
	"problematic" continuum tag and the missing species.

	* src/continua.cc,continua.h(CKD_222_self_h2o,CKD_222_foreign_h2o,
	CKD_242_self_h2o, CKD_242_foreign_h2o, CKD_mt_100_self_h2o,
	CKD_mt_100_foreign_h2o, CKD_mt_250_self_h2o, CKD_mt_250_foreign_h2o):
	Removed abs_n2 as input parameter as abs_n2 is actually not used within
	in these functions.

	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_fast.arts,smr/iss-smr_fast.arts:
	Use full path to f_grid	and sensor_response files in order to be able to
	use these as ARTS include files from everywhere.


2014-07-16  Mayuri Tatiya <maytat@student.ltu.se>

	* arts-2-2-17

	* src/continua.h, src/continua.cc:

	"N2-CIAfunCKDMT250", "CO2-CKDMT250")

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts, abs_o2Set):
	Added variable abs_o2 and a function to derive that from vmr_field as
	required by MTCKD2.5 N2 continuum.

	* src/partition_function_data.cc, src/species_data.cc:
	Added species tags for MTCKD2.5.

2014-07-16  Mayuri Tatiya <maytat@student.ltu.se>

	* arts-2-2-15

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	Removed old code. Fix from jana was correct. We don't have+want an
	operator* overload for Numeric*Vector Multiplication. This problem was
	caused by the one exception we made (operator* for scalar Vector*Vector
	multiplication). The Numeric is automatically casted to a
	ConstVectorView and the following scalar product fails because the two
	Vectors have different number of elements.

2014-07-10  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-2-14

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	* arts-2-2-13

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldMH97, pnd_fieldH11, pnd_fieldH13):
	Revert check for equal aspect ratios introduced in arts-2-1-755 (r8634).
	This seems unnecessary: it's perfectly fine to run those
	parametrizations on different aspect ratio particles (as is, e.g., the
	Hong data for a fixed habit!). In contrast to what arts-2-1-755
	suggests, this has never been a requirement before.

2014-06-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-2-5

	* src/matpackI.cc (vector_angle):

	Due to numerical inaccuracy, the argument to acos might end up being

	caught and 0 is returned.
	
2014-06-17  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

2014-06-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-893

	* CHANGES-2.2: Added some points to General, partly by moving down
	from Key features.

	* arts-2-1-892

	* CHANGES-2.2: Added.

2014-06-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-891

	* src/src/m_nc.h (WriteNetCDFIndexed):

	Call WriteNetCDF instead of calling nca_write_to_file directly.

	* src/src/nc_io.cc (nca_read_from_file, nca_write_to_file),
	src/m_abs.cc (WriteMolTau):

	Put critical regions around all NetCDF IO because the NetCDF C-library
	is not thread-safe.

2014-06-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-890

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalcAppend): Improved consistency checks. For
	absorption species, it is now checked that the same unit is used
	(vmr, nd ...) and for temperature HSE must now either be ON or OFF
	for both parts. Changes after some testing by Ole Martin.

2014-05-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-889

	* src/abs_species_tags.h (SpeciesTag::operator==):

	Also take the CIA dataset index into account for equality comparison.
	Fixes bug reported by Mayuri.

2014-05-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-888

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_basic): It was assumed that
	zenith angle after tangent/turning point is below 90. Fixed.
	Should now work with "super-refractivity".

	(ppath_step_refr_1d): New version of this function. A new approach
	to handle paths starting with zenith angles below 90 and moving to
	> 90 due to "super-refractivity" was needed. The solution was just
	to adopt the 2D algorithm to 1D. That is, refraction in 1D, 2D and
	3D are now handled in basically the same manner.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepRefractionBasic)
	(VectorZtanToZaRefr1D): Adopted call of get_refr_index_1/2d.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc: Removed old version of refr_gradients_1d
	as these functions now use another set of arguments.

	(raytrace_1d_linear_basic): Old version put here.

	* src/refraction.cc: z_field was a vector for 1D etc. This
	differed from e.g. t_field, and z_field now Tensor3 inside the file.

	(refr_gradients_1d): New function, a downscaled version from 2D.

	* src/ppath.cc: Removed everything around do_gridcell_2d (the
	byltest version used). The code of do_gridcell_2d is found in
	ppath_NotUsed.cc.

2014-05-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-887

	* src/m_refraction.cc (complex_refr_indexIceWarren84): BUG FIX!
	The fortran sub-routine got wrong argument. It got 1/lambda, with
	lambda in m. Old code:
	  n = refice_(f_grid[f] / SPEED_OF_LIGHT, t_grid[t]);
	While the input shall be lambda in um.
	For microwaves, this bug had biggest impact below 100 GHz. No
	significant impact for real part between 100 and 1000 GHz.

2014-05-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-886

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_nc.h (WriteNetCDFIndex):

	Added writing of indexed NetCDF files analogous to WriteXMLIndexed.

2014-05-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-885

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	Don't force particles to have same temperature grid.

	Don't calculate top-most pressure levels, it's 0 anyway in pnd_field.

	Bug fix: Only set lower-most pnd_field to 0 if cloudbox does not touch
	the surface.

	* src/methods.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	Add z_field and z_surface as inputs.

2014-05-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-884

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalcAppend): Removed a cout statement, that was
	just added for test purposes.

2014-05-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-883

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, src/m_optproperties.cc
	(ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	Moved to m_optproperties.cc.

	Ignore particles with density <= PND_LIMIT.

2014-05-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-882

	* src/methods.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	Put alphabetically in the correct place.

2014-05-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-881

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, src/methods.cc (ScatteringDoitMergeParticles1D):

	New experimental method to speed up DOIT calculations.

	This method pre-calculates a weighted sum of all particles per pressure
	level before the actual DOIT calculation is taking place in
	*ScatteringDoit*. It should be called directly after pnd_fieldSetup
	(but after cloudbox_checkedCalc).

	*pnd_field* is resized to [np, np, 1, 1]. Where np is the number
	of pressure levels inside the cloudbox. The diagonal elements of
	the new *pnd_field* are set to 1, all others to 0. Accordingly,
	*scat_data_array* is resized to np. Each particle is the weighted sum
	of all particles at this presssure level. This is an experimental
	method currently only working for very specific cases. All particles
	must be of the same type and all particles must share the same f_grid
	and za_grid. And pha_mat_data, ext_mat_data and abs_vec_data must be
	all the same size. This method can only be used with a 1D atmosphere.

2014-05-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-880

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalcAppend): Completed.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Added the test below as a fast one.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ycalcappend/TestYCalcAppend.arts:
	New folder and file.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianClose): Removed jacobian as output.
	It wa sjust sized and set to zero, which anyhow is (and should be)
	done) in yCalc.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed old non-active variables.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Only first element of iy_aux
	was set for "Radiative background".

2014-05-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-879

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalcAppend): Start on new WSM. So far just y
	itself that is handled.

2014-05-19  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-878

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(abs_lines_per_speciesAddMirrorLinesOld): Removed this function,
	since it is obsolete.
	(abs_lines_per_speciesAddMirrorLines): Added const qualifier to
	Index n definition.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_lines_per_speciesAddMirrorLinesOld): Removed.

2014-05-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-877

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesInit):

	Add check to ensure that the species indexes in abs_species_active
	are smaller than the number of species. Fixes assertion reported by
	Theresa.

2014-04-30  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-876

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts:
	Added info on poor DOIT and MC performance.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/DemoScat_DOIT_1D.arts:
	(Re)Define iy_cloudbox_agenda with explicitly setting maxratio in
	iyInterpCloudboxField, using same value as for ClouboxGetIncoming.

2014-04-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-875

	* Reverted 2-1-874.

	Turns out there are a whole bunch of other problems with OS X 10.5.
	As it is EOL anyway, we hereby officially drop support for OS X 10.5.
	I reverted the previous fix because the manual allocation introduces a
	possible buffer overflow.

2014-04-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-874

	* src/file.cc (get_absolute_path):

	Workaround a bug in the C-library realpath function on OS X < 10.6 that
	leads to a crash. Reported by Patrick.

2014-04-29  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-873

	* src/m_ppath.cc (VectorZtanToZaRefr1D, VectorZtanToZa1D):
	Added runtime error catch of sensor position lower than given tangent
	altitude case.

2014-04-29  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-872

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_basic): Improved checks for
	problematic refraction cases. Currently used: check that current
	predicted path point is still within grid cell. Implemented, but
	currently outcommented (switch on & test, please): check that path
	constant rule can be fulfilled over whole grid cell.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_index_airMWgeneral): Minor doc improvement.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/makegeometry3D_*.arts:
	Use refellipsoidForAzimuth for better fitting 1D refellipsoid  to the 3D
	observation geometry. This (almost?) perfectly ensures correct zenith
	angles from tanh for ellipsoidal planet cases (before, north/south were
	undesireably pointing to different effective tangent altitudes than
	east/west for identical tanh requests - indicated by different Tb
	baseline).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_3D_clearsky.arts:
	Cleaned up from planet rotation pseudo-wind testing stuff. Corrected
	info on zang-from-tanh limitations. Set an f_grid that is more
	illustrative of wind effects.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsAtmo3D.arts:
	Switch on E-W winds again, now that planet rotation pseudo-wind issues
	fixed.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts:
	Added more clear doc on limitations of the different scattering solvers,
	specifically in Venus.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Add info on refraction issues to header.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/DemoScat_FOS_1D.arts,
	DemoMars_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Minor fixes.

2014-04-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-871

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_basic): It is clear that some
	cases with very strong refraction not is handled. All should be OK
	for Earth, but low altitudes of e.g. Venus is not properly handled
	with refraction. As a temporary solution, added a check that gives
	a runtime error (giving a rough idea about the problem), to not
	end up with an asseert as before. Some tuning of the crieria for
	issuing the error could be needed.

2014-04-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-870

	* src/methods.cc:

	Add wind_u_field as input to wind_u_fieldIncludePlanetRotation.
	It was only defined as output variable but used as input in the
	implementation.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (wind_u_fieldIncludePlanetRotation):

	Add missing initialization to 0 after resizing wind_u_field. Otherwise
	the += inside the loop is adding to garbage values.

2014-04-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-869

	* src/interpolation.cc:

	Increase FD_TOL from 1e-3 to 1.5e-3 to fix assertion in
	gridpos_check_fd called from ppath_end_1d for Manfred's CIRC case.

2014-04-25  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-868

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts, DemoMarsClouds1D.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/mars/getclouds_mars.arts,
	clouds_mars.arts:
	Added. Martian cloud/dust case files.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsSurface1D.arts:
	Use z_surface from 0th z_field level as preset setting (that's the only
	case when DOIT works...).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts:
	Improved documentation, particularly on scattering solver limitations.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/DemoScat_DOIT_1D.arts:
	More zenith angles in presetting.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts: Minor layout adjustment.

	* src/methods.cc: Spell/formulation fixes.

2014-04-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-868

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsFromCompact):

	Fix assertion. Throw runtime error if abs_species only contains the
	first n species from atm_fields_compact. (n < number of species in
	atm_fields_compact)

2014-04-24  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-867

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts:
	Added/updated documentation. Slight adjustments to (tentatively)
	demonstrate malfunction of refracted path calculation.

	Added/updated cloud case documentation:
	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/DemoScat_[MC,DOIT,FOS]_1D.arts
	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoVenusClouds1D.arts
	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/makeclouds1D.arts

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/
	Demo[Venus,Mars,Jupiter]Atmo[1,3]D.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/createvars.arts:
	Moved more regularly used WSV creation into createvars.arts.

2014-04-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-866

	* src/linerecord.{cc,h} (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Add optional parameter fmin. If the line center is below fmin, skip
	parsing the whole line. This can speed up catalog reading significantly
	depending on fmin (and indirectly fmax).

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitran):

	Pass fmin to LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream.

2014-04-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-865

	!!! IMPORTANT !!!

	From this version on, ARTS will only work with the HITRAN 2012 catalog
	by default. 'cmake -DWITH_HITRAN2008=1 ..' can be used to switch to
	HITRAN 2008.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitran):

	Add runtime error if catalog filename doesn't match the version arts
	was compiled for.

	* CMakeLists.txt, README:

	Add cmake option WITH_HITRAN2008. Update docs.

	* config.h.cmake, src/species_data.cc (define_basic_species_data):

	Use preprocessor variable USE_HITRAN2008 to switch between Hitran
	versions.

2014-04-08  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-864

	* src/species_data.cc: Fixed typo in HNO3 isoratio (thanks oliver!).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestRTwithCIA.iy_reference.xml:
	Updated. Values slightly changed (sub-mK) due to slight changes in
	isoratios of H2O in arts-2-1-862.

2014-04-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-863

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/active/demo_earth_ionosphere.m:
	Correction of header text.

2014-04-07  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-862

	* src/species_data.cc:
	Added CO2-727. Appeared newly in HITRAN2012. NOTE: with this, tag
	assignments for CO2-838 changed in HITRAN. This version of
	species_data.cc still made with 2008-and-older assignments (change to
	2012 prepared: switch manually by out- & uncommenting the respective 2
	lines in here - auto-switch seems not feasible, though.).
	Furthermore, updated all HITRAN iso-abundances to molparam.txt values
	from most recent version (2013!).

	* src/partition_function_data.cc:
	Added CO2-727.

	NOTE: CO2-727 needs also to be added to planet isoratio data files. So,
	also update your arts-xml-data!

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/IsoRatios_H2Oorig.xml:
	Adapted to be consistent with slight changes in species_data.cc.

	* src/methods.cc (iy_Calc), 3rdparty/partFct/partition_functions.py:
	Spellfixes.

2014-04-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-861

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitran):

	Output the line number in error message for easier debugging.

	* src/agenda_class.h (Agenda::push_back):

	Pass MRecord as const reference.

	* arts-2-1-860

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_cloudy.arts:
	Added. Demo cloud case for Venus. MISSING proper DOC.

	Added. Demos/templates for getting venus cloud data. MISSING proper DOC.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/makeclouds1D.arts:
	Added. Include file to prepare cloud data (get scat data into
	scat_data_array and pnd fields into pnd_field_raw, determine cloudbox,
	derive pnd_field from raw data). MISSING DOC.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/venus/controlfiles/
	getclouds_venus.arts, clouds_venus.arts:
	Added. Includes with Venus cloud data definitions and to pre-prepare
	Venus cloud single scattering and pnd data of selected setup for
	digestion into ARTS. MISSING DOC.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoScat_[MC,DOIT,FOS]_1D.arts:
	Added. Demos/templates for scattering solver setups for cloudy cases.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/createvars.arts:
	Predefined some more helper WSVs with view on clouds.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoVenusSurface1D.arts:
	Default setting for t_surface in order to make MC setups (3D!)
	automatically work for all surface settings. Minor doc fix.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/[venus,mars,jupiter]/
	atmo_[venus,mars,jupiter].arts:
	Moved creating of WSV atmobase into createvars.arts (might BREAK Atmlab
	compatibility).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/venus/getatmo_venus.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoVenusAtmo1D.arts,
	controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts:
	Minor doc fix.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_3D_clearsky.arts:
	Re-include possible use of make-and-use-absLUT.arts. With the fixes from
	previous commits, this now also works for 3D. Added some doc on the
	possible use of either make-and-use-absLUT.arts or
	make-and-use-absLUT_1Dfor3D.arts.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts:
	Added note on setting of iy_cloudbox_agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/agendasDOIT.arts:

2014-03-24  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-858

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (find_nonlinear_continua):
	H2-, He-, CH4-CIA added as h2o_abs independent (i.e., not a non-linear
	species).

2014-03-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-857

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (find_nonlinear_continua):

	* arts-2-1-856

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_3D_clearsky.arts:
	Added. A demo case for 3D, here made for making full use of martian
	winds. Also applies planet rotation. Disclaimer: (a) seems to be not
	fully functional when using global fields (some odd things seem going on
	with wind_u_fieldIncludePlanetRotation - asked Oliver to have a look on
	that) and (b) abs_lookup uses a 1D workaround as abs_lookup doesn't
	currently work properly for 3D (but that's ok for the toolbox case(s)
	as the atm data anyway is homogeneous; asked Oliver & Stefan to have a
	look) on the issue.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/
	make-and-use-absLUT_1Dfor3D.arts:
	Added. abs_lookup workaround for 3D cases based on 1D raw atmospheric
	fields (when trying to use 3d raw fields, AtmFieldsCalc will complain,
	i.e., should be save to use without side effects).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/

	Added. Geometry-includes for 3D.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsSurface3D.arts:
	Added. Demo/template for setting surface properties for 3D case.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/getgrids_3Dsimple.arts:
	Discarded hard-coding of lat/lon_grid setup (2pts in each horizontal
	dimension (caused significant deltaTb when using with (inhomogeneous!)
	t_surface from file) and introduced number of grid points in lat/lon as
	user parameter. Using number of gridpoint instead of grid spacing
	ensures that end points are included in either case. Updated
	documentation accordingly & fixed some doc mistakes.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsAtmo3D.arts:
	Introduced number of grid points in lat/lon as user parameter (see
	getgrids_3Dsimple.arts). Switched on winds in repository version. Moved
	abs_f_interp_order setting to any-wind section and removed "only MODIFY
	if you know, what you are doing" warning as you HAVE to reset it if
	winds shall be used. Fixed some spelling and layout issues.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts,
	DemoJupiterAtmo3D.arts:
	Removed "only MODIFY if you know, what you are doing" warning from winds
	section as one HAVE to reset abs_f_interp_order if winds shall be used.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/use-absOnTheFly.arts:
	Removed (re)setting of and references to abs_f_interp_order. That's
	better done in the Demo*Atmo*.arts as there one knows, whether one wants
	winds (and needs to reset abs_f_interp_order), less prone to side
	effects.

	* arts-2-1-855

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake, controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:

	Change naming scheme of testcases. Generate the name automatically from
	the controlfile path (just replacing the directory separator / with .):

	Old: arts.ctlfile.fast.pencilbeam
	New: arts.ctlfile.fast.artscomponents.pencilbeam.TestPencilBeam

	This change makes it much easier to identify the controlfile that
	belongs to each testcase. Omits the need to run
	'ctest -V -N -R arts.ctlfile.fast.pencilbeam' to find out.
	Requested by Jana.

	Note that because the testnames are now longer than before, a terminal
	window wider than 120 chars is required for clean output.

2014-03-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-854

	* src/file.{cc,h} (find_file, find_xml_file):

	In some cases the same file could be found through different paths
	(absolute/relative/~). This led to a warning being issued even though
	the two paths pointed to the same file. All filenames are now converted
	to absolute paths to avoid this. Bug reported by Richard.

	Sometimes the search order was wrong for filenames that needed an
	extension to be appended to be found. find_xml_file would return a
	match from a directory that is placed later in the search path than the
	directory which contains the correct match.

	Reverted change from 2-1-850: Ignoring the search path for filenames
	starting with './' breaks things when running arts from a different
	path than where the controlfile is located. Although using ./ to force
	the file being read from the current directory would be 'more correct'
	than what we do now, the problem is that '.' currently means 'the
	directory where arts is called'. It would work correctly if '.' could
	be expanded to 'the directory where the controlfile / include file is
	located that contains the ReadXML statement for this file'. The cost of
	implementing this logic in the parser doesn't justify the relatively
	low benefits.

2014-03-19  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-1-853
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/linemixing/TestLineMixingAndZeeman_50_to_70_G:
	Updated the slow test so that it no longer fails after arts-xml-data update.
		
2014-03-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-852

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Fix typo in vstr comparison.

2014-03-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-851

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	0 values for quantum numbers were falsely ignored.

2014-03-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-850

	* src/file.{cc,h}:

	(find_file): Improved implementation. Remove unnecessary extension
	argument. Return list of all matching files found in the search path.
	Don't search all paths if filename starts with ./

	(find_xml_file): List all matching files found in warning message.

	(open_input_file): Adapt call to find_file.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario):

	Use new find_xml_file function.

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::parse_agenda):

	Adapt call to find_file.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_data_arrayCheck):

	Indent output messages.

2014-03-19  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-849

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoJupiter_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Added. Complete version for Jupiter 1D clearsky RT.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts, DemoMars_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Corrected note on negative/false tangent altitudes (for both true and
	geometric tanh they can be negative. for tru tanh, they are not allowed
	to be below the actual surface, though.).

2014-03-19  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-848

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoVenus_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Added. Complete version for Venus 1D clearsky RT.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoVenusSurface1D.arts:
	Added. Demo/template for setting/deriving surface properties (altitude,
	temperature, reflection type) for Venus.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Improved documentation following Patrick's comments.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/
	makegeometry1D_refracted-[air,air+electrons]_effectivetanh.arts ->
	makegeometry1D_refracted-[air,air+electrons]_truetanh.arts:
	Renamed effective tanh to true tanh.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/make-and-use-absLUT.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSpectro_core.arts:
	Updated to new atmfields_checked requirements of abs_lookupSetup.

2014-03-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-847

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_index_airThayer): The coefficients in
	the expression applied are now GIN variables, and nominal values
	can now be modified.

2014-03-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-846

	* src/file.{cc,h} (find_xml_file):

	Output full name of the selected and ignored file for better
	diagnostics.

2014-03-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-845

	* src/file.{cc,h} (find_xml_file):

	Added. This method also outputs a warning to out1 if a .xml and
	.xml.gz version of the input file exists. (Suggested by Richard)

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_from_file,
	xml_read_arts_catalogue_from_file):

	Use new find_xml_file function to avoid code duplication.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_cont_descriptionInit):

	Prepend abs_cont_ to variable names to avoid name clash with global
	parameters variable (clang 5.1).

	* src/methods.cc: Add info about extensions automatically being added
	to filenames by ReadXML. (Suggested by Manfred)

2014-03-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-844

	* src/agenda_class.cc (Agenda::execute):

	Add a note to the bad_alloc exception message that reducing the number
	of threads might solve out of memory issues for large jobs. Suggested
	by Jana.

2014-03-13  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-1-843
		
	* src/m_lineshapes.cc:  Fixed unsaved spelling mistake...
	
2014-03-13  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-842
	
	* src/m_lineshapes.cc:  Added "Hui_etal_1978", implementation by
	Rosenkranz.  This is based on a classic paper from 1978 referenced in
	the function's meta data.  This function is most likely faster than
	the Faddeeva algorithm but might or might not fall apart for some input.
	This is not thouroughly tested by me.  The function was added
	to minimize differences between RTTOV and ARTS.
	
	* src/controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/TestZeeman.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/linemixing/TestLineMixingAndZeeman.arts:
	Modified to also use the "Hui_etal_1978" line shape. (Note that I did 
	not have to change the reference file!).

2014-03-11  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-841

	* src/m_checked.cc (atmfields_checkedCalc): Be a bit more helpful in
	abs_f_interp_order-in-case-of-wind error message (you have to set it >0
	even if absLUT are not used).

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:
	Downgrade the do-only-modify-when-you-know message on abs_f_interp_order
	as user HAS to change it if wind is to be used.

2014-03-10  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-840
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  BUG.  There was a difference between theory in the 
	Zeeman paper and code in ARTS.  They way it was coded, horizontal and 
	vertical polarization got shift around.  I found this while restructuring
	the code to make it easier to compare with theory.

2014-03-07  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-839

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc

	(abs_lookupSetup): Pass atmfields_checked as input. To avoid
	abs_lookupSetup acting on (obviously) buggy data like negative
	temperatures. Remove a bunch of checks that are obsolte now as they are
	checked by atmfields_checkedCalc.

	(choose_abs_nls_pert): Avoid letting maxdev become infinity (as we can
	not divide a range [x,inf] into any number of steps and will forever
	stay in the make-steps while loop). And if it (still) is, throw a
	runtime error.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (NumericInvScale): Added. A method to perform a
	divide. This as plenty of divide operations can only be represented by
	multiplication in an ugly way.

	* src/methods.cc: Adapt to the above changes.

	* src/species_data.cc: Corrected H2S HITRAN tag assignment. It's
	basically a HITRAN bug: For H2S HITRAN does not follow its own
	convention that tags are sorted in terms of isotopologue abundance.
	However, it's a very old bug, hence probability that HITRAN will fix it
	is low. So, we have to do something to make ARTS work properly with
	buggy HITRAN. If not fixed (i.e., for all previous ARTS	versions!),
	HITRAN-to-ARTSCAT conversion of H2S minor isotopologues is WRONG!

	* src/absorption.h (SpeciesRecord): Removed check for increasingly
	sorted HITRAN tags. This to allow the above change to work.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestRTwithCIA.iy_reference.xml:
	Updated with values matching modified O2 & H2O data in Perrin line data.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloDataPrepare.arts:
	Do atmfields_checkedCalc before abs_lookupSetup.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/spectrotest.py:

	(get_data): Consider that each abs_species entry is an array of tags and
	allow for multi-tag entries.

	(first_substring): Catch case when substring is not found.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex:
	In CIA part, added note on CO2-CO2 alternative.


2014-03-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-838

	* Things fixed, inspired by question from Jana:

	* src/m_sensor.cc (AntennaConstantGaussian1D): The algorithm for
	setting up mblock_za_grid was not perfect. I had selected
	"cumsum", while "cumtrapz" is a better option to avoid what could
	be seen as an edge effect. Also added a runtime check.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (antenna_responseGaussian): Added a runtime check.

	* src/methods.cc: Editing to reflect change below, for affected
	methods.

	* src/sensor.cc (gaussian_response_autogrid): The creation of the
	grid slightly changed, from using linspace to nlinspace. To ensure
	perfect fit with defined end points. Now the spacing adjusted
	accordingly, downwards. So grid spacing now becomes slightly
	smaller.

2014-03-05  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-837

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:  Added one slow line mixing test.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/linemixing/*:  There is one more test here
	that shows how to set this up for the entire band.  I might add a test
	later to show how to do Zeeman for one line but Line Mixing for the
	entire band.  The other files are updated because I had forgotten that
	artscat4 requires all species to be defined.  This error was pointed out
	to me by Jana.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/*:  The files are updated because I
	had forgotten that artscat4 require all species to be defined.
	This error was pointed out to me by Jana.

2014-03-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-836

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Parse additional quantum numbers v1, v2, v3 and f. Check that species
	is O2 because the format for other species is different.

2014-03-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-835

	* src/m_sensor.cc (antenna_responseGaussian)
	(backend_channel_responseGaussian): Just changed to use
	gaussian_response_autogrid.

	(antenna_responseVaryingGaussian): New WSM.

	* src/sensor.cc (gaussian_response): Now this function just
	calculates the gaussian response. That is, a more proper "core"
	function.

	(gaussian_response_autogrid): The old function renamed.This one
	also creates a grid.

2014-02-28  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-834

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:  Added two line mixing tests.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/linemixing/*:  These are the tests.  There
	is still no reading routine to get vibrational numbers out of Agnes
	catalog, so these tests are only preliminary and will have to be 
	extended at a later date when this reading routine is in place.  The 
	problem with not reading the vibrational state is that we do not know
	inside ARTS which line is supposed to be line matched --- no two lines
	are allowed to be matched with the same input.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/*:  More strongly linked this test
	to arts-xml-data, removing the magnetic field files that this folde used
	to contain.

2014-02-27  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>
	
	* arts-2-1-833
	
	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:  Activated a Zeeman test if arts-xml-file
	is in path.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/*:  Adapted the Zeeman test.  Note
	that there are differences between the previous HITRAN using test and
	this test that uses Agnes catalog.  These differences were at 45 K.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc:  Added a simple check to allow the user to set
	the magnetic field strength manually.  Useful for model comparisons.

2014-02-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-833

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Fix parsing of QuantumNumbers N + J.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/TestZeeman.arts:

	Read from Agnes Catalog.

2014-02-25  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-832

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc: Added the function below.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Added the function below

	* src/m_reduce.h: Function to reduce higher order tensors to lower order
	tensors.  Can, e.g., convert a 1x4 matrix to Vector type.  This is a
	simple function that is complementary to the Extract function.

2014-02-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-831

	* src/matpack{VI,VII}.cc: Hot fix for hudson build error.

2014-02-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-830

	* src/matpack{III,V}.cc: Missed these in previous commit.

2014-02-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-829

	* src/matpackVI.{h,cc}, src/matpackVII.{h,cc}: Add get_c_array.

	* src/matpack*.cc: Make error message for get_c_array less convoluted.

2014-02-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-828

	* src/sensor.cc (sensor_integration_vector): Changed expressions
	for x2 and x3, to avoid numerical problems for e.g. (f+df)^3-f^3.
	A slight rewrite of c0 and c1, common term now outside ( ).
	Added an error message, if f >=0 and and any h <= -small_value.

2014-02-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-827

	* src/m_general.cc (Test): Now including a test of
	sensor_integration_vector and sensor_integration_vector2. It
	confirms that sensor_integration_vector gives exact result when
	the two functions are piece-wise linear.

	* src/sensor.cc (sensor_integration_vector): Header text improved.
	Some cleaning/changes of the code. The only real change is that
	the grid normalisation is changed. The normalisation now maps x_f
	to [0,1] (before x_g). In addition, the final result did not
	consider this normalisation. This was a bug, but still all OK with
	sensor_norm set to 1. 

	A note: Tried to deactivate normalisation and the Odin-SMR test
	then raised an error. Seems that Tb changed with 7 K. So the code
	appears to be sensitive for numerical issues ...

	(sensor_integration_vector2): A version of the function above, but
	strictly following the sensor repsonse article.

	* src/sensor.cc: Removed some old inactive code related to Stokes
	rotation.

2014-02-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-826

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Added running file below, as part
	of fast.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/stokesrot/TestStokesRotation.arts:
	A file demonstrating and testing Stokes rotation, as well as shows
	how to simply set up an atmosphere lacking attenuation.

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyZero): New WSM. Use with care!

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs): Now handles the case of no abs_species.

	* src/m_checked.cc: A small fix to avoid crash if abs_species is
	empty. Then no need to search for negative VMRs.

2014-02-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-825

	* src/m_sensor.cc: Removed some inactive code at end of file. This
	including an old version of new method below.

	(sensor_responseStokesRotation): New WSM .

	* src/workspace.cc: Added stokes_rotation.

2014-02-19  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-824

	* AUTHORS:  Added myself to "important component" contributor list.
	Remove or move as you see fit.

	* doc/uguide/absorption_theory.tex:  Changed the Zeeman part of the
	theory to only reference the Zeeman module paper.  The old text was
	written before there was support for DJ=0 species, and before we had
	taken into account magneto optics.

	* doc/uguide/references.bib:  Added the Zeeman paper.  If there is
	another way to reference 'internal' papers, please let me know.

2014-02-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-823

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Fix link libraries for test_omp. (Bug reported by Patrick)

2014-02-06  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-822

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/
	DemoMars_fullRT_1D_clearsky.arts:
	Added. Complete version for 1D clearsky RT.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/:
	Added. Folder for active/passive shared templates (user is supposed to
	modify these files).

	DemoJupiterAtmo1D.arts, DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts, DemoVenusAtmo3D.arts,
	DemoJupiterAtmo3D.arts, DemoMarsAtmo3D.arts:
	Moved here from controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/common/DemoMarsSurface1D.arts:

2014-02-03  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-821

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/fullRT_Mars.arts:
	Continued to work on. Included:
	- selectable level of refraction (via INCLUDEs)
	- selectable way of absorption calc (via INCLUDEs)
	- applicable also with wind and stokes_dim>1 (tested)

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/
	makegeometry1D_unrefracted.arts,
	makegeometry1D_refracted-air_effectivetanh.arts,
	makegeometry1D_refracted-air+electrons_effectivetanh.arts,
	makegeometry1D_refracted-air_geometrictanh.arts,
	makegeometry1D_refracted-air+electrons_geometrictanh.arts:
	Added. Bunch of plug&play type INCLUDEs to prepare viewing geometry
	setup (allowing to specify and handle both viewing angles AND tangent
	altitudes within one run) and handle different ways of refraction.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/use-absOnTheFly.arts,
	make-and-use-absLUT.arts:
	Added. plug&play type INCLUDEs to handle different ways of absorption
	calculations (LUT, OtF).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/My-Version-Of-DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts:
	Unbreak wind settings (getwinds_mars.arts didn't like NSwind and EWwind
	to be conmpletely ignored).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts,
	DemoVenusAtmo3D.arts, DemoJupiterAtmo3D.arts, DemoMarsAtmo3D.arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/passive/My-Version-Of-DemoMarsAtmo1D.arts:

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSpectro_core.arts
	Updated to unbreak (for changes related to CIA inclusion).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/spectrotest.py:
	Improved plotting and stats report for spectroscopy tests.

	* src/species_data.cc, workspace.cc, m_abs.cc,

2014-01-20  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-820

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (Adapt): Added runtime error if a species
	is missing in the lookup table, but requested in the
	calculation. (On request by Jana Mendrok.)

2014-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-819

	* src/ppath.cc: Removed some lines now obselete after changes in
	the do_gridcell_Xd_byltest functions. Found by Oliver, using Xcode
	code analyser.

2014-01-14  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-818

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc), src/rte.cc (iyb_calc):

	Extract parallel loop bodies into separate functions. Works around the
	OpenMP performance issue mentioned in previous commit when neither the
	mblock nor za loop actually run vectorized.
	Speed ups vary. E.g. TestWfuns runs 25% faster on our 32 core server
	when number of cores > nza.

	Print diagnostic info about parallelization and iteration count to
	out3.

	(iyb_calc): Further tweak parallel loop condition for za loop. Only
	delay parallelization if nf >= 10*nza.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2):

	Remove duplicate code. los and dza where calculated twice for
	atmosphere_dim <= 2 (inside and after the if statement).

	* src/debug.h (DEBUG_VAR, DEBUG_VAR_FLT): Added more debug macros.

	* src/m_disort.cc (ScatteringDisort):

	Use DEBUG_VAR instead of DEBUG_PRINT.

	* src/xml_io.cc (ArtsXMLTag::read_from_stream): Initialize ch.

2014-01-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-817

	* src/m_checked.cc (sensor_checkedCalc): Added special check that
	sensor_response_aa is empty if antenna_dim = 1. Not catched before.

2013-12-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-816

	* OpenMP performance improvements.

	* rte.cc (get_ppath_trans):

	Remove parallelization.

	Performance breaks down if threads > 4. This behavior is consistent
	with different compiler versions on different operating systems and
	machines. It can lead to deadlocking. OdinSMR test case with 32
	threads sometimes never finishes. For explanation see below.

	* src/test_omp.cc, src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add testcase to illustrate performance impact of 'nested' OpenMP loops.

	Case 1): Runtime without #pragma omp in outer loop.

	Case 2): Runtime with #pragma omp if (0) in outer loop, still only
	the inner loop will run in parallel exactly as before.

	(1) Laptop 8 threads:  6.3s
	(2) Laptop 8 threads: 22.1s

	(1) Server 8 threads:  3.2s (CPU Load 700-800%)
	(2) Server 8 threads: 36.3s (CPU Load only 300%)

	This is a quirk with OpenMP. When the program starts, OpenMP creates X
	threads (X=8 in the test above). In case (1), these threads will be used
	for parallelizing the inner loop.
	However, in case (2), even though the outer loop runs sequentially due
	to the if (0) condition, OpenMP cannot use the already existing 8
	threads for the inner loop. Every time it enters the inner loop, it
	has to create 8 new threads. As creating threads is very expensive,
	this leads to the seen drop in performance.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex:  Added a warning about using HITRAN04
	and HITRAN08 in conjunction with line mixing.  There appears to be
	some quantum coding error in the older versions of HITRAN that causes

	solution is to use HITRAN2012.  I am presently uncertain how/where to
	warn the user in ARTS about this issue.

	* arts-2-1-805

	* Made some changes that hopfully shall decrease the risk to mix
	up rtp_pos and rte_pos when used for interpolation. This commit
	brakes backwards-compatibility:

	InterpSurfaceFieldToRtePos changed to InterpSurfaceFieldToPosition
	InterpAtmFieldToRtePos changed to InterpAtmFieldToPosition.

	For both these methods, the GIN pos is removed. The standard
	choice to use as position is rtp_pos. This is now default.

	Please check that rte_pos is not used here in your cfiles (that
	was the case earlier).

	Adopted to changes below. Switched to use pre-defined agendas in

	used instead of rtp_pos! This had no effect as 1D, but would
	otherwise give incorrect results.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Updated to match
	changes below.

	* src/m_surface.cc (InterpSurfaceFieldToPosition): Renamed from

	Also added z_surface as input to allow that rtp_pos is roughly
	consistent with the surface altitudes.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (InterpAtmFieldToPosition): Renamed from
	InterpAtmFieldToRtePos, and changed pos (GIN) to rtp_pos (IN).

	* Defined 100 MHz as the lower frequency limit if there is any
	refraction due to free electrons!

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_index_airFreeElectrons): Changed check
	with respect to plasma grequency to use f_grid[0]. Also added a
	general demand that f_grid[0] is >= 100 MHz, to have a safe margin
	to birefringence (following article by Hartmann and Leitinger).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/demos/active/demo_venus_ro.m:
	Adjusted axis for one plot.

2013-10-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-796

	* Made some additions to test if they could help decreasing impact

	"peaks".

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (p_gridDensify): New WSM.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/venus/atmo_venus.arts,
	DemoVenusAtmo1D.arts, DemoVenusAtmo3D.arts:

	demand_vmr_value shall be used with care.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_basic): Tangent point a few mm

	* arts-2-1-771

	* Removed/changed stuff stopping iyRadioLink to be used with
	ppath_agenda__FollowSensorLosPath. This combination can i fact be
	very useful.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Removed if statement
	demanding transmitter. rte_los now an input, passed on to
	ppath_agenda.

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_sat2sat): Changed if-statement detecting
	if limb sounding is being performed. Old one demanded tracking of
	transmitter.

	* controlfiles/general/continua.arts: Added O2-MPM89 support since it is
	already in ARTS.

2013-10-09  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-768

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/mars/getatmo_mars.arts:
	Remove grid settings recently introduced by Patrick. We rather do them
	in a separate include (and they do not belong in here, where we just
	read the raw atmospheric grids).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/TestMarsAtmo.arts:
	Removed. Gets replaced by the files below.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/DemoMarsAtmo[1,3]D.arts:
	Added. Demos/templates for getting mars atmospheric data. Separate
	setups for 1D and 3D. They replace the previous TestMarsAtmo.arts.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/getgrids_1D.arts,
	getgrids_3Dsimple.arts, getgrids_3Dspaced5deg.arts:
	Added. Include files that create p/lat/lon grid purely on
	p/lat/lon_min/max specifications by the user (everything else set or
	extracted internally).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/makemagfield.arts,
	makefield1D.arts, makefield3D.arts:
	Use named parameters instead of positional passing.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/createvars.arts:
	A string variable added.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	Added abs_xsec check within outcommented make-LUT part.

	* arts-2-1-766

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts:
	Updated reference values, to have a clear reference (data and
	platform given as comment in file). Increased tolerance for y to
	2e-17, following data reported by Nicolas. This is about 2%, but
	impact of numerical inaccuracy on defocuisng results are high (see
	comment for arts-2-1-495)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/test_faraday.m: Improved
	comment and accuracy of scaling factor.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex: Corrected a citep to citet.

2013-10-06  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-765

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, methods.cc (ParticleTypeAdd, ParticleTypeAddAll,
	ParticleType2abs_speciesAdd):
	Removed p/lat/lon_grid as passed variables. We don't need them in there.
	Whether they are consistent with atmosphere_dim is not necessary to be
	checked HERE!

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestClouds_Mars.arts,
	TestClouds_Venus.arts:
	Added. Cloud data tests.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Cloud data test added to test suite.

	* arts-2-1-763

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc,methods.cc
	(lat_gridFromRawField, lon_gridFromRawField):
	Added. For extraction of lat_ and lon_grid from data grids. Similar to
	p_gridFromZRaw, but acting on a generic GriddedField3 instead of on
	z_field_raw.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/helpers/TestGridsExtract.arts:
	Added. Testing above introduced grid extraction including cropped grids
	as introduced in 2-1-759.

	* arts-2-1-761

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc(GriddedFieldPRegrid,GriddedFieldPRegridHelper):
	No attempt of interpolation if old grid is completely outside new grid.
	Rather set everything to 0 if zeropadding (else throw error, as usual).
	Fixes issue reported by Patrick in 2-1-760.

2013-10-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-760

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_index_airMWgeneral): Commented out
	if-statement demanding that sum(vmr) is close to 1. This is not
	working together with the Mars data. Discussed with
	Jana, and seems difficult to keep the constrain. Note that the
	method applies a "rescaling" to sum(vmr)=1. 

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/mars/getatmo_mars.arts: 
	Found a setting p_grid resulting in an assert error. Not tracked
	down, but setting left as a comment in the file.

2013-10-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-759

	* Jana and I have decided on a general principle for inclusion of
	atmospheres. Basically following what is already in place in eg.
	getatmo_mars.arts, but extend to automatically set p/lat/lon_grid,
	with the option to crop the grids. Some first step to implement this:

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (VectorCrop): New WSM. Note default values,
	trying to mimic +-Inf. For example this works:
	  VectorCrop( out=p_grid, in=p_grid, min_value=0.1e2 )

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/TestMarsAtmo.arts: Removed
	setting of p_grid, lat_grid and lon_grid.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/mars/getatmo_mars.arts:
	p_grid, lat_grid and lon_grid are now set here. lat_grid and
	lon_grid set to be empty if not 3D. Values for 3D are just test
	values, things will be improved ...

2013-09-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-758

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Defined.
	refr_index_air_agenda__GasThayerAndElectrons.

	This as refr_index_air_agenda__GasMWgeneralAndElectrons is NOT
	working for Earth, as water vapour is not considered at all by
	the MWgeneral method.

2013-09-23  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-757

	* src/{continua.{cc,h},species_data.cc,partition_function_data.cc},
	controlfiles/general/continua.arts: Added Tretyakov et al. 2005 mpm-like
	continua model.  Call "O2-TRE05" to get to it.  This addition is just a
	copy of mpm93 with the Tretyakov et al. 2005 numbers instead of the mpm.

	* src/{m_zeeman.cc,linerecord.cc}:  Added some quantum number reading
	for N and J so Zeeman Hund case b should work now.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Changed text on Zeeman here since NO can do
	b-case now.  Also added O2-TRE05 to the right list.

	* arts-2-1-755

	* src/methods.cc (scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrix):
	Updated GIN and description due to the changes for the aspect
	ratio and size inputs.
	Numeric aspect_ratio --> Vector aspect_ratio_grid
	Vector diameter_grid --> Vector diameter_max_grid

	* src/workspace.cc (scat_meta):
	Corrected two errors in the description.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrix):
	Changed size input from equivalent diameter to diameter_max
	and changed the aspect ratio from Numeric to Vector. Added a
	loop to calculate meta data for each combination of diameter_max
	and aspect_ratio. 
	Before the diameter_max was calculated, now it's the volume
	that is calculated from diameter_max and aspect_ratio.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldSetup):
	Added a new PND parametrization with an included shape
	distribution (H13Shape).

	* src/cloudbox.cc: 
	(pnd_fieldMH97, pnd_fieldH11, pnd_fieldH13):
	Added a check to make sure that just one aspect ratio is used
	for these parametrizations, just as before.

	(pnd_fieldH13Shape):
	The new PND parametrization with an included shape
	distribution (H13Shape).

	(IWCtopnd_H13Shape, area_ratioH13):
	The actual parametrizations containing the equations and
	variables to calculate the PND and area ratio based on temperature.

	* src/cloudbox.h:
	(pnd_fieldH13Shape, IWCtopnd_H13Shape, area_ratioH13):
	The same parametrizations have been added as in 
	src/cloudbox.cc.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrixSSD.arts:
	Updated due to the changed inputs (diameter_max_grid and
	aspect_ratio_grid)

2013-09-04  Johan Strandgren  <johsat-9@student.ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-754

	* src/optproperties.h (ScatteringMetaData):

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldSetup):
	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldH13, IWCtopnd_H13, scale_H13):
	* src/cloudbox.h (pnd_fieldH13, IWCtopnd_H13, void scale_H13):
	Added the updated version of Heymsfield's PSD from 2013. Very
	similar to the earlier version (H11), only updated variable values.
	
	* src/methods.cc (complex_refr_indexRegrid): Removed this WSM 
	used for interpolation of the refractive index.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc
	(complex_refr_indexRegrid): Deleted and replaced with a built-in
	interpolation function inside scat_data_arrayFromMeta instead (see below).
	(scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrix): removed check-function for refractive index.
	Simplified and clarified the equation used for calculation of diameter_max.
	(scat_data_arrayFromMeta): Added a built-in interpolation function that 
	interpolates the refractive index to fit the frequency and temperature grids
	chosen for the T-matrix calculations.

2013-08-23  Johan Strandgren  <johsat-9@student.ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-753

	* src/methods.cc:
	(complex_refr_indexIceWarren84, complex_refr_indexIceLiebe93):
	Renamed GINs:  f_grid --> data_f_grid
		       t_grid --> data_T_grid.

	(complex_refr_indexRegrid): Added new WSM to interpolate
	complex_refr_index.

	* src/m_refraction.cc:
	(complex_refr_indexWaterLiebe93): Added a warning if 
	temperatures below 250 K are used.			

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc:
	(complex_refr_indexRegrid): Added the interpolation method
	mentioned above.
	(scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrix): changed complex_ref_index to be IN
	instead of GIN. Updated the variable names in the check functions.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrixSSD.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts:
	Adapted the changed variable names.

2013-08-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-752

	* After discussion with Stefan, removed abs_check. This leaves

	* arts-2-1-749

	* Polishing of last commit. Mixed CloudboxGetIncoming with
	iyInterp.... The CloudboxGetIncoming WSMs shall use the checked
	WSVs. Added these WSVs also to some other WSMs not even using
	basics_checked, but should have done. Fixes pointed out in email
	from Jana. Thanks.

	* ChangeLog: Edited entry for 2-1-748, to not have misleading
	information in the file.

	* src/m_disort.cc (ScatteringDisort):
	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming)
	(ScatteringDoit,CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm): Now using abs_checked,
	atmfields_checked and atmgeom_checked and cloudbox_checked.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Earth.arts:
	Changed to 1e-6 also here. Not needed, but for consistency.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Mars.arts:
	Test using this file failed worked my work desktop, but failed on
	home Mac desktop. The diff on the Mac was 1.1e-8, and the limit
	was set to 1e-8. A very hard limit, now relaxed to 1e-6. Diffs
	below 1-e3 should have no practical importance.

2013-08-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-748

	* Warning! New WSVs and WSMs introduced. You need to change your
	2.1 cfiles. Basically all cfiles should be affected.

	* Revision of the variables and method of check-type now
	activated. More WSVs of checked-type, for better modularity and
	making the variables easier to use in WSMs.

	Note that the checked-variables only are used in methods normally
	called directly in the control file, but not used in methods
	normally placed in agendas, for efficiency reasons. So, yCalc,
	ppathCalc etc. uses the variables, but I have removed old checks
	in e.g. iyMC to be consistent with this rule.

	That is, if you make direct calls of methods like iyMC and
	iyEmissionStandard its on your own risk. If you use bad input for
	such calls, you can obtain an assert instead of an error, or even
	worse, incorrect result. However, you can of course call e.g.
	atmfields_checkedCalc anyhow before calling e.g. iyMC. That will
	decrease the risk of bad surprises later on.

	For a claculation with yCalc you now need these calls
	   propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc
	   abs_checkedCalc
	   atmfields_checkedCalc
	   atmgeom_checkedCalc
	   cloudbox_checkedCalc
	   sensor_checkedCalc

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC):
	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Now not using any of the

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc): Now using
	abs_checked and atmfields_checked, instead of basics_checked.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iy_auxFillParticleVariables):
	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Now using atmfields_checked,

	* src/m_checked.cc (basics_checkedCalc, basics_checkedCalcNoGeo):
	Removed these WSMs and related internal functions. Code already
	reused in atmfields_checkedCalc, atmgeom_checkedCalc.

	(propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc): Commented out
	needs_free_electrons, variable not used.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed basics_checked, and added:

	* src/methods.cc (particle_massesFromMetaDataSingleCategory):
	Extended doc text, for hopefully better clarity.

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2poslos): Removed assert of
	abs( abs(za) - RAD2DEG*acos(dr) ) < 1e-4

	Added this assert as a double check that correct angle was
	resolved and there is no real loopholes in the code. Ole Martin
	now got a case with a difference of 1.018e-4. This is a numerical
	issue. No point in just relaxing the assert, the assert has
	fulfilled its purpose.

	* Work in progress, no active changes yet.

	* Start on revision of checked WSVs and WSMs. Following the lines
	of Jana's changes, but instead using more WSVs. And trying to
	better distinguish between atmospheric and absorption parts. For
	example, basics_checkedCalc requires f_grid to be set, while
	f_grid is not always used, such as when calling ppathCalc.
	Now planning to have these flag WSVs:
	  abs_checked
	  atmfields_checked
	  atmgeom_checked
	  cloudbox_checked
	  sensor_checked

	For abs_checked to be true, both abs_xsec_agenda_checked and
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked must be true, and some additional
	tests done. So it is a "super flag" for the absorption part.

	* src/m_checked.cc: New file and placed all WSM returning
	checked-variables here. The idea is by putting them side-by-side
	it should be easier to make sure that the checks are complete and
	there is a good logic between the methods.

	(atmfields_checkedCalc, atmgeom_checkedCalc, abs_checkedCalc): New
	methods, not yet active.

	* Corrected date for commit below.

2013-08-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-741

	* README: Extend section on enabling / disabling Fortran features.

	warning about Complex C++ return type used in C call to refice_. It's
	fine.

	Remove f2c related code.

	* config.h.cmake: Remove f2c cmakedefine.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Removed test_disort. Now in 3rdparty dir.

	* arts-2-1-739

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (particle_massesFromMetaDataSingleCategory):
	New WSM. Can set particle_masses from scat_data_meta_array for
	some special conditions.

	* src/m_general.cc (Test): Just removed verbosity to avoid
	compiler warning.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (complex_refr_indexWaterLiebe93): Changed
	built-in doc to reflect change below.

	* src/refraction.cc (complex_n_water_liebe93): Changed lower
	temperature limit to -40.

	* src/m_tmatrix.cc (scat_data_meta_arrayAddTmatrix): Defined
	default for material and density, as a way to indicate that they
	are not actuall needed for T-matrix (as description, already
	having "" as default). Default for density is -999, to get a
	number that is easy to detect as unphysical.

	* src/workspace.cc: A very small change of text for
	particle_masses.

	* src/species_data.cc,partition_function_data.cc:
	A bit of cleaning up (tag updates, layouting, missed data updates) after
	arts-2-1-721.

	* arts-2-1-737

	* 2D ray tracing now following the approached already used for 3D.
	Less elegant but seems needed to get away from a constant tuning
	of settings to handlle the numerical problems. 

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_2d): Now calling
	do_gridcell_2d_byltest. If you run into problems with the new 2D
	ppath calculations, just change if(0) to if(1) on line 3311.

	(raytrace_2d_linear_basic): As above, including a if-statement to
	switch back to old code.

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2pol, cart2poslos): Changes to get the

	* src/m_refraction.cc (ParticleRefractiveIndexConstant)
	(ParticleRefractiveIndexWaterLiebe93)
	(ParticleRefractiveIndexIceWarren84): Renamed to start with
	complex_refr_index. In all cases changed output from being GOUT to

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceFlatRefractiveIndex): Adopted to change
	of type for surface_complex_refr_index.

	(surface_complex_refr_indexFromGriddedField5): Also adopted, and
	changed to take Field4 to Feidl5 as input. The new dimension is
	temperature, to be fully consistent with complex_refr_index.

	* src/workspace.cc: Redefined surface_complex_refr_index to
	GriddedField3. Removed old complex_refr_index and replaced with

	* arts-2-1-732

	* src/linerecord.cc: Reading from HITRAN now gets the quantum numbers
	for Zeeman. There is something wrong in the 2004 paper explaining the
	format because it seems the Symmetry field is also 2A1, not just as
	stated in the text that the Branch letter is 2A1, for OH.

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Changed dmin from 1e-12 to
	5e-12. A setting to handle numerical problems. Another case from
	Ole Martin required a dmin of 1.8e-12 to be handled. So increased
	dmin with some margin.

2013-08-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-723

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Improved check if TOA reached. Added

	fixed one failing case provided by Ole Martin.

2013-08-12  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-722

	* doc/uguide/refr_index_theory.tex: Added. Moved refractive index
	(models) theory/background parts from AUG to here and merge info
	from ESA-Planetary TN1 into it. Currently an own chapter; in
	future rather make it a section in propagation paths chapter?

	* doc/uguide/refr_index.tex: Minor updates, corrections. Few parts
	moved to ATD.

	* doc/uguide/arts_theory.tex: Include the refractive index chapter.

	* src/linerecord.cc: Reading some quantum numbers for ClO and NO now.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Preliminary compatibility with NO and ClO now. Not
	tested yet. Any suggestions on how to test this? I could not find any 
	models doing this.
	
	* src/quantum.{h,cc}: Added QN_Omega.
	
	* src/partition_function_data.cc, src/species_data.cc: Can now work with
	HITRAN2012 based on the HITRAN ref-table.pdf. For isotopes already in 
	these files, I only added the HITRAN tag number. For isotopes of already
	existing molecules, I assumed Q(T) to by from the most abundant of the
	species, the mass was calculated from the most common isotope with
	integer addition for all extra mass. 
	
	For new molecules, the atomic mass
	as an integer of the isotopic parts was assumed, C4H2 was assumed linear
	and SO3 assumed non-linear for the Q(T)={T,T^1.5}, and were thus given 
	the corresponding degree of freedoms. HBr have 2 molecules with molecule
	number "11" in the new HITRAN. The latter of these is now named 11_2 in
	ARTS, whilst the first remains unchanged in name. 
	
	The completely new isotopologues are: HNO3-156, HBr-29, HBr-11_2, HI-27, 
	N2-45, and COF2-369
	
	The completely new species are C4H2, and SO3.
	
	The isotopologues new in HITRAN2012 number are: HCl-25, HCl-27, HF-29, H2-11,
	and H2-12.
	
	Some check-all tests will fail with this commit.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Uh, mixed up rows and cols.
	Now changed to x[is] = -trans_partial(iv,is,0,ip)*dbdt;
	And also noticed that a factor 2 was not included in x[is] for
	is>0. So that was another bug.

	of single_scattering_dataCalcTMatrixTest, that potentially could
	be the basic WSM for T-matrix. Work in progress.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/tmatrix/TestTMatrixSSD.arts: Some
	small changes in existing code to get the file to run. Added a
	second part calling single_scattering_dataFromTmatrix.

	stokes_dim > 1. Replaced (iv,0) with (iv,is) in for loop.

	* src/methods.cc: Reverted change in arts-2-1-695. That is, for
	jacobianAddPolyfit, changed default for no_pol_variation back to
	0. This is the best default value. It is up to qpack2 to handle
	possible complications.

	* arts-2-1-707

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc): Removed requirement for

2013-07-25  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-705

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Added sections on
	propmat_clearskyAddFaraday and propmat_clearskyAddParticles. Added info
	on setting isotopologue_ratios. Moved input-to-LbL paragraphs into their
	own subsection (it's not only for LbL. and that way we have a proper
	place to document how to set iso ratios). Minor updates (it's propmat
	now!), rewording, re-layouting, spellfixes...

	* doc/uguide/references.bib: Zeeman paper added.

	* doc/uguide/absorption_theory.tex: Updated info on isotopologue ratios
	(not hard-coded anymore!)

	* arts-2-1-702
	
	* doc/uguid/absorption.tex:  Zeeman is now a subsection of "Calculating gas

	Catch case of rtp_los not specified (happened when methods get called
	from propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc).

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc): Temporary(?) bugfix.
	Do NOT require all 3 magfield components to be explicitly specified, but
	allow implicit zero-setting for separate components. This particularly
	circumvents silently ignoring magfield as happened with previous version.

	* doc/uguide/refr_index.tex: Added internal reference to Faraday section.
	

2013-07-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	src/m_xml.{h,cc}:

	Add option no_clobber to WriteXML and xml_write_to_file.
	Appends an incrementing number to the filename if it already exists.

	(WriteXMLNoClobber): Removed. Sorry Richard, I decided to make
	no_clobber a flag to WriteXML instead.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_lines_per_speciesWriteToSplitArtscat),
	src/m_batch.cc (ybatchMetProfilesClear), src/m_doit.cc

2013-07-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-695

	* src/methods.cc: For jacobianAddPolyfit, changed default for
	no_pol_variation from 0 to 1. This as a temporary fix to allow
	Qpack2 to be used with stokes_dim > 1. Need to think how this
	shall be handled. I assume that nobody is affected by this change.

2013-07-09  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-694

	* src/m_xml.{cc,h}: Dummy added (WriteXMLNoClobber). This does

	gets added twice.

2013-07-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-690

	The interface between ARTS and the T-Matrix Fortran codes, as well as
	providing the same functionality as PyARTS, is now pretty much
	completely. Except for calculating the refractive index,
	calcSingleScatteringDataProperties now does the same as
	SingleScatteringData.calc in PyARTS.

	TODO:

	- Integration of calcSingleScatteringDataProperties with the rest
	of ARTS, so that it can be practically used.

	- Better error handling if Fortran code fails.

	- Ensure all calls into the Fortran codes are threadsafe (via omp
	critical).

	* src/tmatrix.{cc,h}:

	(calcSingleScatteringDataProperties):

	Calculate Csca integral for oblate and prolate particles and from that
	K_abs.

	(integrate_phamat_*):

	Add gauss legendre integration for phamat over different angles
	thet0, phi, alpha.

2013-07-04  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-687

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Added some tests for 3D atmosphere and ppath_los
	being defined that was missing. Also made the test of quantum numbers
	print more information when the user defines Zeeman species that are
	not really Zeeman affected.

2013-07-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-686

	* src/tmatrix.cc:

	(integrate_phamat): Add Gauss Legendre phase matrix interpolation.

	* arts-2-1-683

	* doc/uguide/references.bib, doc/uguide/absorption.tex: Added Zeeman
	explanation. Made line mixing explanation more exhaustive. I am not entirely
	certain if this is sufficient as documentation, but it should now explain
	the steps necessary to attain make the program run.

2013-06-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-682

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/TestZeeman.arts: No change done.
	This test case now runs again, after the change below. But there
	is a deviation to reference data of -0.043 K, that is outside the
	set limit of 0.01 K.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (Part_Return_Zeeman): Added "if( temp_lut.size()
	> 0 )", on line819. This fix suggested by Richard.

2013-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-681

	* More work in progress on T-Matrix code.

	* 3rdparty/tmatrix/{ampld.lp.f, ampld.lp.f.orig, ampld.par.f,
          ampld.arts.f, tmatrix_ampld.ref}:

	Added T-Matrix codes for nonspherical particles in a fixed orientation.

	ampld.arts.f is based on the version in PyARTS. Added RAT as a
	parameter, renamed subroutines that are also present in tmd.arts.f to

	* src/tmatrix.cc, src/tmatrix.h, src/m_tmatrix.cc:

	Added. Basic integration of low-level T-Matrix codes for randomly
	oriented nonspherical particles. Fortran routine tmd can be called from

	tmd.lp.f, tmd.lp.f.orig, tmd.par.f, tmd.pyarts.f}:

	Added T-Matrix codes for randomly oriented nonspherical particles.
	For ARTS I rely on the same version as used by PyARTS. It has already

	src/m_abs.cc (WriteMolTau), src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_mat_fieldCalc),
	src/workspace.cc, src/methods.cc:

	Rename abs_mat_field and abs_mat_fieldCalc to propmat_clearsky_field
	and propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (propmat_clearsky_fieldCalc):

	Add mag_*_field as input. Add checks for magnetic field.
	Add los Vector as generic input.

2013-06-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-669

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Same changes as
	below.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): ppath_awx now a pointer
	variable. Change after discussion with Oliver. Not sure if
	previous version was a bug or not. This would then affect u and w
	component wind jacobians.

	Removed k1 and k2 variables from T-jac part.

2013-06-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-668

	* src/linerecord.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Allow one extra space at the end of the line. Workaround for formatting
	bugs in HITRAN 2012.

2013-06-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-667

	* Extension of analytical Jacobians ready. Memory usage decreased
	for larger calculations involving Jacobians or iy_aux (but the
	reversed can happen for small calculations). There should also be
	a slight speed improvement for analytical Jacobians.

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: Some more details on temperature, general
	case.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Changed to mimic
	iyEmissionStandard as far as possible. Old jacobian code removed.
	Replaced with code from iyEmissionStandard, but with all emission
	terms removed and no special treatment of Stokes 1 for
	unpolarised case.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): New version now active.
	Code for Jacobians with polarised absorption in place.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink):
	* src/m_fos.cc (fos):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Adopted to change of
	get_ppath_abs. Required some reorganisation of code.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs): Now two output variables. One with
	summed absorption, and one with "abs_per_species", but only for
	selected species. This in order to avoid repeated summation of
	absorption. Memory usage is also decreased, except when all
	species are either retrieved or their absorption is put into iy_aux.

	(get_ppath_trans2): Adopted to new version of ppath_abs.

	(get_ppath_trans): Adopted to new version of ppath_abs. Some
	internal variables could be removed.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard2): Temporary playground for
	extending WFs to also handle polarised absorption.

2013-06-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-664

	* Work to avoid repeated checks if ext_mat is diagonal. Mainly
	justified for extension of WFs, but should give a slight general
	speed improvement.

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Adopted call of
	get_ppath_trans and emission_rtstep.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard, iyRadioLink):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Adopted call of get_ppath_trans.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans, get_ppath_trans2): Adopted call of
	ext2trans, and added output argument to pass on icase.

	(emission_rtstep): Added input argument matching icase. This
	avoids a call of is_diagonal, for each frequency.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral):
	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): Adopted call of ext2trans.

	* src/doit.cc (rte_step_doit): Adopted call of ext2trans, and
	using icase to remove a call of is_diagonal.

	* src/rte.cc (ext2trans): The found structure of ext_mat is now
	returned, as *icase*. If icase already known, that information can
	also be provided to save time.

2013-06-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-663

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: Corrected some mistakes from writing
	earlier today. Resurrected some text about more fully handling the
	vector case analytically.

2013-06-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-662

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: A complete rewrite of the analytical
	expressions. Now common terms are really discussed first, and
	separately. And the complete calculation procedure is represented
	mathematically. Hopefully more easy to understand what is
	actually done, and the difference between unpolarised and
	polarised more clearly separated.

2013-06-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-661

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseMixer): Check of symmetry of
	response grid allowed a margin on 1kHz, but that cause problems in
	the core functions. Now no margin allowed. Safest, and simplest
	for the implementation. This opens for potential practical
	problems due rounding errors in files etc., but hopefully possible
	to handle ...

2013-05-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-660

	* src/rte.cc (ext2trans): Added comment explaining why
	  assert( ext_mat(0,0) >= 0 );
	is removed.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Added argument
	negative_vmr_ok. If false, vmr_field now demanded to be >= 0. This
	is set to be default.

	Note the difference for t and vmr: t>0 while vmr>=0

	Made also search for negative f_grid more efficient. Just needed
	to check for element when the vector is known to be increasing.

2013-05-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-659

	* src/rte.cc (ext2trans): Commented out assert( ext_mat(0,0) >= 0 );
	This assert made qpack2_demo in atmlab to fail. I guess due to
	negative vmr. Uh, not sure how to handle this and removing the
	assert to avoid the problem for the moment!

2013-05-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-658

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: A number of smaller corrections.

2013-05-29 Oscar Isoz <oscar.isoz@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-656

	* src/rte.cc (ext2trans) : Fixed a sign error in the assertion

	* arts-2-1-654

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex (subsubsection{General case}): Finished a

	* arts-2-1-653

	* src/sensor.cc (find_effective_channel_boundaries):
	Minor bugfix found just after the last commit

	* src/m_sensor.cc (f_gridFromSensorAMSUgeneric):
	Fixed an issue with how the passband frequency grid is calculated

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseGenericAMSU): Found (and fixed)
	a discrepancy in how the properties of the AMSU-A sensor is saved
	in amsua.arts vs how it is used in this function.

	Introduced a slight reduction in the effective bandwidth of the
	channels by 60 Hz in order to avoid for them to merged by
	f_gridFromSensorAMSUgeneric
	(this was donet to save computational time and make more room for
	optimisations of the frequency grid)

	* arts-2-1-651

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: Changed to use Jacobian in preference of
	weighting functions. Some rearrangement to introduce expressions
	for polarised absorption.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Some typos from last commit, and expanded
	slightly around calculation of matrix exp.

2013-05-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-650

	* src/logic.cc:

	(is_increasing): Adapt the if statement so that the functions correctly
	return false if the Vector contains NaN values:

	if( x[i] <= x[i-1] ) return false;
	->
	if( !(x[i] > x[i-1]) ) return false;

	Although logically the same for floating point numbers, the second
	implementation behaves correctly for NaN values because any comparison
	with NaN returns false.

	(is_decreasing, is_sorted): Same.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Add test44 to check above changes.

2013-05-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-649

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_field): Error now thrown if field
	contains NaNs. Implemented for both versions of the function.

2013-05-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-648

	* doc/uguide/rte_basics.tex:
	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Replaced a few B with \Planck.

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: Included a high number of "symbold_defs".

	* doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt: Added symbol_defs.tex dependencies.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: Removed some odd, and not used,
	definitions. Fixed some comment typos.

	Bold i was used both for Stokes vector and total
	vector of pencil beam monochormatic data, so to avoid this clash
	redefined as follows
	  \PpathLng: s changed to l
	  \StoVec: i changed to s

	Added: \SttElm with friends and \Trn with friend.

2013-05-22  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-647

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/mars/*.arts:
	Added include files for getting Mars atmospheric setups (selecting
	scenario and species/parameters to include, reading in, and bringing
	to calculation grids).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/Test{planet}Atmo.arts:
	Moved the previous My{planet}.arts from their respective directories to
	here as these are the templates for the actual main controlfiles (we
	don't want to hide them too far down). Made all includes absolute (allow
	to use or include this file from anywhere).

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/venus/[getatmo_venus,getwind].arts,
	controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/common/createvars.arts:
	Minor docu- and bug-fixes.

2013-05-22 Oscar Isoz <oscar.isoz@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-646 

	* src/sensor.cc (find_effective_channel_boundaries):
	Modified the code so that it can ignore frequencies where the filter
	response explicitly  is set to zero, particularly useful for the  AMSU-A
	channels. 

	* src/m_sensor.cc (f_gridFromSensorAMSUgeneric):
	Added support to have set a separate frequency grid spacing for each channel

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseGenericAMSU):
	Minor bugfixes, main change was to make the slopes of edges of the
	backend_channel_response f_grid edges constant.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt, instruments/amsu/TestAMSUA.arts : 
	Added AMSU-A test case, not run by default yet

2013-05-22  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-645

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (GriddedFieldLatLonRegrid):
	Bugfix. Added check for new lat/lon_grids not empty in the beginning,
	before any of them is tried to be used.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_mat_fieldCalc), methods.cc,workspace.cc:
	Minor updates of variable namings and variable descriptions.

2013-05-21  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-644

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/includes/[common,jupiter,venus]/*.arts:
	Added a couple of controlfiles (of includes nature) for getting
	atmospheric setups (selecting scenario and species/parameters to
	include, reading in, and bringing to calculation grids).
	My{planet}.arts	is the respective main file for each planet. It's
	supposed to be used as template - i.e., for usage, make a copy of it
	and modify according to	your wishes.
	It's work in progress, some things not in satisfying state yet (too
	much room for bugs/breaking the file), evaluating better options.

2013-05-21  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-643
	
	* src/partition_function_data.cc: Defines partition function type in the
	defaults to allow for other types of partition functions.
	
	* src/absorption.h: Changed mqcoeff to a Vector and added some more 
	variables. These are: mqcoefftype which is defined from the public enum and
	influences what type of partition function will be used in the switch added
	to (alculatePartitionFctRatio) to change between the previous standard way
	of only allowing coefficients in the now called 
	(CalculatePartitionFctAtTempFromCoeff) to also allowing gridded funtions 
	that can be interpolated in (CalculatePartitionFctAtTempFromData). To use
	the new FromData function it is necessary to specify the grid, the data and
	the interpolation order in present design, together with the partition 
	function type.
	
	* src/absorption.cc: Here (CalculatePartitionFctAtTempFromData) is defined.
	
	* src/methods.cc: Added format documentation to 
	(ArrayOfLineMixingRecordReadAscii).

2013-05-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-642

	* src/m_basic_types.h: Add missing Array types for nelemGet.

2013-05-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-641

	* Work on MC, to finish changes to just use ext2trans.

	Used a calculation with 200e3 photons to check that result not
	changed. (ext2trans and matrix_exp_p30 also compared directly).
	The change made MC 1-2% slower, but MC can now handle any ext_mat
	(at least for this step, before p30 or simpler was assumed) and
	now ext_mat is asserted carefully.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	Uptaed references values to 198.7 and 7.9 K, assuming that this
	file should give same result as the one below.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts:
	Updated reference value to 198.7, which was the combined result of
	two 200k photon runs, see above.

	* src/m_general.cc (Test): Commenetd out present test code (as
	using matrix_exp_p30.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (matrix_exp_p30): Moved to mc_NotUsed.cc.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): Switched to use
	ext2trans, that required some internal changes (opp_depth_mat ->
	ext_mat).

	* src/rte.cc (ext2trans): Synced header with content. Removed old
	version of the function.

2013-05-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-640

	* Started to clean up conversion of extinction to transmission.
	Beside for MC, this is now only done by ext2trans. One step
	forward is that ext2trans checks all expected symmetries of
	ext_mat.

	Also tried to make it faster by using special expressions for
	"p30". In matlab the special expressions are one order of
	magnitude faster than Pade, but the overall improvement in ARTS is
	only marginal. Hence, ARTS' Pade-approximation is very fast, or
	the matrix exponential is not a calculation bootleneck.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (matrix_exp): Only Pade-approximation is now
	done. Special treatment of diagonal matrices removed, now checked
	before calling the function.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (matrix_exp_p30): Several terms calculated
	twice, now instead copied.

	* src/mc_interp.cc (interpTArray): Moved to mc_NotUsed.cc.

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): Now using ext_mat, instead of matrix_exp.
	And also using the flag introduced below.

	* src/doit.cc (rte_step_doit): Now takes a flag telling if
	trans_mat is already calculated. Now using ext_mat, instead of
	matrix_exp.

	* src/rte.cc: Removed declaration of unused constants.

	(get_ppath_trans, get_ppath_trans2): Now using ext_mat, instead of
	matrix_exp.

	(ext2trans): Rewritten and extended. Expected symmetry of ext_mat
	now fully checked. Matrix exponential calculated in three
	different ways depending on structure of ext_mat. The three cases
	are diagonal, "p30" and general. For p30 special expressions are
	used, following matrix_exp_p30 and double-checked with a text book.

	* arts-2-1-640

	* src/rte.cc (ext2transNEW): New version of the function below,

	matrix_exp called instead. Work to do ...

	* arts-2-1-637

	* src/lineshapes.cc: Confirmation on which order Faddeeva's frequency grid
	should be arranged. It is the opposite of how Jefferies etal wrote it down.
	Changed the function Accordingly
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Made this compatible with line-mixing. Differences of 1 K
	in the Bern test simulations followed.

	See builtin docs of ArrayOfLineMixingRecordReadAscii and
	line_mixing_dataMatch.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_lines_per_speciesCreateFromLines): Cosmetics.

2013-05-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-635

	* src/rational.{h,cc}:

	(Rational::Rational(int)): Add conversion ctor for int.

	(bool()): Removed. Conversion operators are evil for all the pitfalls
	they bring along, so let's get rid of them.

	(Numeric()): Renamed to toNumeric();

	(Index()): Renamed to toIndex(). Change the assert to a runtime error.
	Otherwise invalid conversions from Rational to Index will go unnoticed
	in non-debug mode. E.g. 3/2 would be silently converted to 3.
	Simplify code by not calling Simplify() (on a copy of the object).
	Rational objects are always immediately simplified when they're
	modified or initialized, no need to do it here again.
	Move implementation to cc file. 

	Get rid of arithmetic and boolean operators where second
	argument is not a Rational. They were only implemented in one direction,
	e.g. Rational + Index worked but not Index + Rational.
	Instead of implementing a dozen more operators, let's get rid of them
	altogether.

	Sometimes less is more: By removing the conversion operators, all the
	operations work in both directions (Index+Rational and Rational+Index).
	Because now, the compiler has no other choice than converting the other
	argument into a Rational. Exactly what we want!

	Moved all operators that don't modify the object outside the class.

	Only implement full logic for operator== and operator<. Implement all
	other boolean operators by calling those two.

	(assignment operators): Should always return a reference to the object
	itself. Assignment operator with Index no longer needed. Uses converting
	ctor implicitly.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Use Rational::toNumeric.

	* src/quantum.h (QuantumNumbers::operator[]): Change return type to const.

	* src/interpolation_poly.cc:

	Do same caching for LOOPIDX as for LOOPW.

	Move the CACHE* statements from the innermost loop to the outer loops
	right after the corresponding variables definition.

	* src/test_matpack.cc: Add test43 for Rational.

	Adapt for type change of line_mixing_data from ArrayOfArrayOfVector to
	ArrayOfArrayOfLineMixingRecord.

	* src/m_linemixing.cc (line_mixing_dataRead):

	Read the species tag from the line mixing data file. Improved parsing
	of data values.

	* src/absorption.{h,cc} xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order):

	Change local variables data and lut to reference type to avoid
	unnecessary copying of arrays.

	* src/make_auto_md_h.cc, make_auto_workspace_h.cc:

	Include linemixingrecord.h in generated code.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc, src/xml_io_array_types.cc,

	* arts-2-1-631

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): Shit, by copy and paste one for-loop became
	wrong (used nfs instead of nf). Caused a bug with
	use_mean_scat_data set to true (a case I had not tested).

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_ext): Extended header test, to be clearer
	around use_mean_scat_data.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: use_mean_scat_data now set
	here, to 0.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxOff): Now NOT setting

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc, src/xml_io_instantiation.h,
	src/xml_io_types.h:

	Implement xml io routines for QuantumNumberRecord and QuantumNumbers.

	* src/rational.h: Use element initialization list in constructors.

	Remove copy assignment operator. The implicit one will do just fine.

	Remove assignment operator for int.

	* src/linemixingrecord.{cc,h}: Add stub for line mixing data class.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add linemixingrecord.cc to artscore.

	* src/test_quantum.cc: Updated.

	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_no_background):

	Get rid of the pointers for swapping around the two propmat_clearsky
	instances. Use the new swap() function instead. More readable code.

2013-05-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-629

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts: Adopted to
	renamed agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Changed NoPol to Pol
	for surface_rtprop_agenda__Specular_Pol_Water_SurfTFromt_field.
	This agenda is based on surfaceFlatRefractiveIndex, that is of
	polarised nature.

	* src/methods.cc: Corrected several typos for
	surfaceFlatReflectivity.

2013-05-02  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-628

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (GasAbsLookup::Extract): Pre-calculate
	interpolation weights outside species loop for speed
	optimization.

2013-05-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-627

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_f): Added more comments to the function.
	To hopefully in the future avoid confusion about the signs to
	apply for the terms. For a moment I got lost here ...

2013-05-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-626

	* src/matpack*.h (*::get):

	Add a non-asserting element accessor to Vector, Matrix and Tensor*
	View classes. Should only in places were maximum speed is of the essence.

	* src/interpolation.{h,cc}:

	Cache the begin() and end() iterators in loops. Use the matpack get
	function inside the loops.

	Speeds up interpolation, especially the GasAbsLookup::Extract function.
	For example, arts.ctlfile.slow.amsub runs 30% faster.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc), src/rte.cc (iyb_calc):

	Tweak OpenMP loop condition for cases where the number of frequencies
	is smaller than nmblock and nza.

2013-05-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-625

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species):

	Fix bug for lineshapes that don't calculate phase information. ls_phase
	was never initialized and garbage values where used in later
	calculations. this_ls_phase *= this_fac was up to 2 times slower
	under some circumstances (mostly in the profiler) when t_l_p contained
	garbage.

	Further phase calculations are now skipped if the chosen lineshape
	doesn't return phase. Still some memory allocation overhead left.

	Would be much nicer to be able to pass in a zero-sized xsec_phase to
	skip the phase calculations altogether. But that's tricky with the
	current use of Views.

	Removed variables base_attenuation and base_phase as they were only
	used in one place.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines):

	Don't make a full copy of another variable and then set it to zero.
	Instead use the appropriate constructor to create it with the right size
	and value in one go.

2013-05-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-624

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc:

	Add assertion to *_agendaExecute functions to make sure the input_agenda
	is valid.

	* src/agenda_class.h (checked): Add access function.

2013-04-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-623

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos): Now using ext_matFromabs_vec.

	* src/rte.cc (get_iy_of_background): Added chk_not_empty call for
	all agendas used. To catch highly non-standard usage where
	dummy agendas can end up to being called.

	* src/check_input.cc: Type for x was wrong for most chk_size
	functions.

2013-04-30  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-622

	* src/optproperties.[cc,h] (ext_matFromabs_vec): Added. Method for
	deriving/setting an extinction matrix from the absorption vector.

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyAddParticles): Replacing own code for
	extinction matrix from absorption vector by ext_matFromabs_vec.

2013-04-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-620

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc (SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag):

	Make parsing of SpeciesTag strings more robust. Invalid frequency
	numbers where silently ignored. Same for wrong placement of Zeeman
	tag. It must be located after the species, not after the isotopologue.

2013-04-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-619

	* src/m_fos.cc: Now also fos_za_interporder considered.

2013-04-30  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-618

	* Nicer (not mis-using pnd_field) version of handling particles as
	absorbing-only, reverting obsolete parts of the older version.
	Now EACH particle type is added as an instance to abs_species, with its
	pnd field going into the corresponding vmr_field(_raw) entry. Single
	scattering data continue to be hold in scat_data_raw (we disallow
	parallel usage of "particles" in abs_species and scattering (i.e.,
	cloudbox on) calculations). A new method added - 
	ParticleType2abs_speciesAdd - corresponding to ParticleTypeAdd
	(corresponding version of ParticleTypeAddAll to come soon), which adds a
	"particle" instance to abs_species, reads the single scattering data,
	reads and appends pnd data to vmr_field_raw.

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyAddParticles):
	Adapted for looping over abs_species, handling multiple "particles"
	instances therein (provinding propmat_clearsky separately for particle
	type).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc):
	Added check that abs_species has not "particles" while cloudbox is on.

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc (check_abs_species):
	Removed obsolete requirement of only one "particles" instance in
	abs_species.

	* src/rte.[cc,h] (get_ppath_atmvars, get_ppath_abs):
	Removed parameters ppath_pnd, pnd_field, cloudbox_on.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard), m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar),
	m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink, iyTransmissionStandard)
	m_fos.cc (fos):
	Removed ppath_pnd, pnd_field, cloudbox_on from calls of
	get_ppath_atmvars and get_ppath_abs.

	* src/agendas.cc (propmat_clearsky_agenda),
	montecarlo.cc (clear_rt_vars_at_gp, cloudy_rt_vars_at_gp),
	disort.cc (dtauc_ssalbCalc), m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_mat_fieldCalc)
	doit.cc (cloud_RT_no_background, cloud_ppath_update1D_planeparallel):
	Removed obsolete usage of rtp_pnd in propmat_clearsky_agenda call.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed rtp_pnd.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc):
	Removed pnd_field checks and method parameters pnd_field, cloudbox_on.

	* src/cloudbox.[cc,h] (chk_pnd_data, chk_pnd_raw_data):
	Remove obsolete parameters p_grid, lat_grid, lon_grid.

	* src/m_append.h (Append): Added a version for Tensor-to-Tensor append
	(leading dimension only). Needed for appending (modified) data (like
	profiles/fields of a single absorbing species) to vmr_field.

	* src/array.h: spell fix.

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted to changes above.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts,
	doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts, helpers/TestAgendaCopy.arts,
	montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts,
	faraday/TestFaradayRotation.arts:
	Removed rtp_pnd usage in propmat_clearsky_agenda definitions.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:
	Removed obsolete pnd_field=0 and cloudbox_on=off settings.

2013-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-617

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC):

	Fix parallelization of frequency loop. There is no further
	parallisation in the MonteCarlo code, therefore it is best to
	parallelize for nf>1 instead of nf>max_threads.

2013-04-29  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-616

	* Implemented frequency interpolation in lookup table extraction,
	to allow for more elegant Doppler shift treatment.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.{h,cc}
	(GasAbsLookup:fgp_default): Added this new member, which holds the
	trivial frequency grid positions (without frequency interpolation).
	(GasAbsLookup::Adapt): Initialize fgp_default.
	(GasAbsLookup::Extract): Implemented frequency
	interpolation. Required significant reorganization. The new
	philosophy is to first determine grid positions for all
	dimensions, including trivial grid positions in case a dimension
	should not be interpolated. Then the code for the interpolation
	itself (calculate weights and interpolate) can be the same for all
	cases. So, overall messiness somewhat reduced.

	* src/rte.cc
	(get_ppath_abs): Get rid of rtp_doppler, directly pass ppath_f
	to propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute.
	(get_ppath_f): Inverted the sign of the Doppler shift. For
	absorption features to shift to higher frequencies, the
	calculation grid for the absorption calculation has to be shifted
	to lower frequencies. With this change, the TestWinds control file
	gives the same result as before. Patrick, please confirm my change.

	* src/montecarlo.cc: Adapted.

	* src/disort.cc: Adapted.

	* src/doit.cc: Adapted. Also removed or commented-out some cout
	command that seem to be old debugging remnants.

	* src/interpolation_poly.cc (gridpos_poly): Implemented nearest
	neighbour interpolation (interpolation order 0). This is very
	handy, because it can be used to make interpolation code robust to
	the case that a particular dimension should not be interpolated at all.

	* src/test_interpolation.cc: Test the new order 0 interpolation.

	* src/main.cc
	(arts_mod_time): Added "compiled" to give some
	indication what the date/time means.
	(main): Added a copy of the command line to the report output. My
	main reason is that I wanted see the name of the control file from
	the report file. But perhaps also useful to see what other
	switches were used.

	* src/workspace.cc (rtp_doppler): Removed. Bye-bye.

	* src/methods.cc (propmat_clearskyAddFromLookup)
	(propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly, propmat_clearskyAddZeeman): Removed
	input argument rtp_doppler. Updated documentation.

	* src/agendas.cc (propmat_clearsky_agenda): Removed input argument
	rtp_doppler.

	* src/m_abs.cc (propmat_clearskyAddOnTheFly): Removed input argument
	rtp_doppler and code handling it.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (propmat_clearskyAddZeeman): Removed input argument
	rtp_doppler and code handling it.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc
	(abs_lookupCalc): Initialize fgp_default.
	(propmat_clearskyAddFromLookup): Added input argument
	abs_f_interp_order. Considerably simplified the function itself,
	since more work is now done in GasAbsLookup::Extract.
	(abs_mat_fieldCalc): Adapted. Also renamed all
	ampsXXX variables back to absXXX. This method still takes Doppler
	shift as input (it is just used for plotting and testing purposes,
	where this is handy). It constructs a new frequency grid and
	calls propmat_clearsky_agendaExecute with it. A remark: It would
	make sense to get rid of the Stokes dimension in
	abs_mat_field. abs_mat_fieldCalc can anyway not handle effects
	that would cause polarization, so only the (1,1) element of the
	absorption matrix (propmat_clearsky) is of interest here. And then
	revert both to their old names (abs_field and abs_fieldCalc).
	(calc_lookup_error): Adapted.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestAbsDoppler.arts:
	Adapted and tested.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts: Cosmetics.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts: Set
	abs_f_interp_order to 1, to avoid runtime error with wind
	Jacobians.

2013-04-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-615

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Added Transmission as aux var.

	* src/methods.cc: Polishing of escription of Transmission and
	Optical dept aux variables

	* ChangeLog: Slight edit of message for 2-1-613 to make clear that
	the comment refers to a specific method, and not generally for the
	file.

2013-04-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-614

	* ChangeLog: Fix version numbers in previous two commits.

2013-04-29  Mathias Milz  <mathias.milz@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-613

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_responseWMRF): removed the check if the
	f_grid is inside the sensor_reponse_function. This is apparently
	obsolete.

2013-04-29  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-612

	* src/lineshapes.cc: Made the lorentz function slower by calculating the
	phase shape function as well, which is necessary for Zeeman and line mixing.

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order): Fixed error in the
	mathematics that ignored the first-order line-mixing. Also, it only accepts
	calculations if the specified line-shape returns the phase, as this is
	necessary for line-mixing. Also, now takes data in SI units. The data
	will soon be added to arts-xml-data.

2013-04-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-611

	* src/matpack*.{h,cc}:

	(Sparse):
	Don't use pointer variables for the members mdata, mrowind and
	mcolptr.
	Several advantages: No custom memory management needed -> Copy
	constructor, copy assignment operator and destructor removed. Code is
	much more readable.
	(mult, transpose): Non-const iterators were used to loop over elements
	of the const input parameter.

	(*Iterator*):
	Remove copy constructor from all Iterator classes. The implicit one
	generated by the compiler does just fine. And in C++11 the
	presence of a custom copy constructor will prevent the generation of
	an implicit move constructor. Might give better performance.

	(Vector, Matrix, TensorX):
	Change the argument type of the assignment operator from a const
	reference to a call by value. This way, we can let the copy
	constructor do the work instead of duplicating its initialization code
	in the assignment op. Additionally, with this implementation, the copy
	assignment operator will also work as a move assignment operator in
	C++11. And this implementation is exception safe. With the previous
	one, if the copy operation failed, the current object was left in an
	undetermined state.
	Add swap function to swap two objects.

	* src/xml_io_basic_types.cc: Adapt for Sparse changes.

	* src/matpack.h: Include debug.h

	* src/debug.h: Include iostream, add some std::.

	* controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/yREFERENCE*.xml: Add ref values.

	* controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/TestOdinSMR*.arts:

	Compare y against reference.

	* src/m_fos.cc (fos):

	Add explicit cast to Numeric for 'nin' in division to silence compiler
	warning.

2013-04-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-610

	* src/m_fos.cc: A complete version. So far only 1D only, and just
	a few rudimentary checks made.

	* src/doit.h: Included rte_step_doit.

	* src/doit.cc (rte_step_doit): Removed some inactive old lines.

2013-04-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-609

	* src/test_complex.cc, src/test_gridded_fields.cc, src/test_linalg.cc
	src/test_matpack.cc, src/test_tensor.cc:

	Forgot to fix the test_* files in previous commit.

	* src/describe.{cc,h}: Use our String class instead of the standard
	string. Good example for a type error that went unnoticed before
	because std::string was visible everywhere although we don't want to
	use it.

2013-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-608

	* src/matpack.h: Remove 'using namespace std;' from header. It is bad
	practice because it pollutes the global namespace of every file it is
	included by. Removing it here makes at least matpack behave nicely.
	Still present in arts.h.

	* src/array.h src/complex.{cc,h}, src/exceptions.h, src/fastem.cc,
	src/file.h, src/gridded_fields.{cc,h}, src/make_array.h,
	src/matpack*.{cc,h}, src/mystring.h, src/rational.{cc,h},
	src/sourcetext.{cc,h}:

	In header files, add prefix std:: to all entities from the std
	namespace.

	In cc files, it is ok(ish) to use 'using namespace std;'. But it is
	preferable to only import what is actually used. This can be done at
	the beginning of the file after the include directives,
	e.g. 'using std::runtime_error;'.

	* src/sourcetext.cc (operator<<): Write to os not cout.

	* src/jacobian.h (RetrievalQuantity):

	Remove unneeded copy constructor.

	Change type of grids argument in constructor from MakeArray<Vector> to
	ArrayOfVector.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc: Remove unnecessary assignments of
	RetrievalQuantity() in variable definitions.

2013-04-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-607

	* src/m_fos.cc: Extended, but still not complete. 

	* src/methods.cc: GIN for sensor_responseBackendFrequencySwitching
	had inconsistent names.

	* src/workspace.cc: Introduced fos_scatint_angles and fos_iyin_za_angles.

2013-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-606

	* src/linerecord.{cc,h}:

	Added.  Move LineRecord class from absorption.{cc,h} into its own file.
	It's a large class and absorption.{h,cc} became very cluttered.
	Also moved all method documentation from the cc into the header file.

	(LineRecord::ReadFromHitranStream): Rename to ReadFromHitran2001Stream
	to be consistent with ReadFromHitran2004Stream.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromHitranPre2004):
	Call lr.ReadFromHitran2001Stream.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}: Remove LineRecord class. Remove unnecessary
	includes. Include linerecord.h.

	* src/mystring.h:

	Moved extract helper function from absorption.cc to here. It is not
	specific to absorption and might be handy for other cases.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add linerecord.cc to artscore.

2013-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-605

	* src/continua.{cc,h}:

	Move definition of constant variables with model data to .cc file.
	Reduces header file size by 200kB.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc:
	* src/m_fos.cc:

	* src/m_transmitter.cc:
	* src/m_rte.cc: Adopted all calls of get_ppath_abs.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs): Introduced only_sum_abs. This flag
	can be set to true when only summed absorption is needed, that in
	some cases will save considerable amount of memory. Cases where
	this flag must be false is when abs_species jacobians are
	calculated, "abs per species" is aux output and when Faraday is
	aux output.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans): Removed obselete comment about
	Faraday.

	* src/m_fos.cc: Further work on reimplementation ...

2013-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-603

	* src/matpack.h:

	Include cmath before applying the isnan-isinf-fix for GCC C++11.

2013-04-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-602

	* src/absorption.h (LineshapeRecord):

	Add bool member to store if this lineshape calculates phase
	information. Important to determine later whether this lineshape can
	be used for line mixing calculations.

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order):

	Add example code for Richard on how to get LineshapeRecord::Phase().

	* src/global_data.h: Declare lineshape_data and lineshape_norm_data.

	* src/lineshapes.cc (define_lineshape_data):

	Add PHASE or NO_PHASE to each LineshapeRecord constructor call.

	Define lineshape_data and lineshape_norm_data inside global_data
	namespace.

	* src/m_abs.cc: extern const... -> using... for l_d and l_n_d.

2013-04-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-601

	* Cleanup of global variables.

	* src/global_data.h:

	Gather extern const declarations of all global variables in a separate
	namespace and document in which files the variables are defined.

	If you need access to a global variable (e.g. md_data), include this
	file and make the variable visible in the function where you need it
	with:

	using global_data::md_data;
	(The old way was: extern const Array<MdRecord> md_data;)

	Now you can access the variable as usual: md_data.bla();

	To keep things clean, this file should never be included in .h files,
	only in .cc files.

	* src/globals_2.cc:

	Removed. Moved definitions into the cc files where the initialization
	function of each variables is implemented.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Remove globals_2.cc.

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc, src/absorption.{cc,h},
	src/agenda_class.cc, src/agenda_record.cc, src/agendas.cc,

	src/make_auto_md_cc.cc, src/make_auto_md_h.cc,
	src/make_auto_workspace_h.cc, src/methods.cc, src/methods_aux.cc
	src/parser.cc, src/partition_function_data.cc, src/species_data.cc
	src/test_quantum.cc, src/test_xml.cc, src/xml_io_compound_types.cc,
	src/main.cc:

	Import global_data.h where needed and replace all 'extern const...'
	statements by 'using global_data::...'.

	* src/abs_species_tags.{cc,h}, src/absorption.{h,cc}:

	Move species_index_from_species_name and
	species_name_from_species_index from a_s_t to absorption.
	They act on the species, not on the species tag. Also removes the
	necessity of SpeciesMap being a global variable which is defined in
	absorption.cc.

	* src/absorption.{h,cc} (LineRecord::BroadSpecSpecIndex):

	Move implementation to cc file.

	* src/matpack.h: Move isnan and isinf fix from arts.h to here.

	* src/debug.h: Added. Move debug macros from arts.h to here.

	* src/arts.h: See above.

	* arts-2-1-599

	* src/absorption.h: Two new functions:
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) and
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order) that will act as a line
	mixing layer for (xsec_species).

	* src/m_linemixing.cc: Fix to work with new ArrayOfArray*
	line_mixing_data*.

	* src/m_abs.cc: Made line_mixing_data* active variables. Added
	call to
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) where appropriate.

	* src/absorption.cc: (xsec_species_line_mixing_wrapper) and
	(xsec_species_line_mixing_2nd_order) added. When utilized with
	data from Makarov etal 2011 these will change O2 band near 6 GHz
	both positively and negatively (I have seen at most 1 K). These
	still require more testing.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines,
	propmat_clearskyAddZeeman):

	Add line mixing as input.

	* src/abs_species_tags.{cc,h} (SpeciesTag):

	Add line mixing type support.

	(SpeciesTag::operator==): Add mtype and mline_mixing_type.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines):

	Prepare for line mixing support.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:

	Touch line_mixing_data and line_mixing_data_lut.

	* arts-2-1-597

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Cosmetics.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (GasAbsLookup::Adapt): The current species
	list may now contain species that are not included in the original
	lookup table IF they are trivial species, such as free electrons
	or zeeman species, for which there is no lookup table absorption
	anyway. The data for these additional species is simply set to
	NAN, the same value that *GasAbsLookup::Adapt* would produce.

	* src/check_input.h (runtime_error_not_found,
	runtime_error_not_unique): Added these two new classes, which are
	public derivatives of *runtime_error*.
	(chk_contains): Use the new error classes. This makes it possible
	for the caller to selectively catch one of the two error
	conditions, which is needed in *GasAbsLookup::Adapt*.

2013-04-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-596

	* src/abs_species_tags.{h,cc} (check_abs_species):

	Gather checks for abs_species in one function.

	* m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_speciesSet, abs_speciesAdd, abs_speciesAdd2):

	Call check_abs_species after modifying abs_species.

2013-04-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-595

	* src/m_linemixing.cc, src/methods.cc, src/workspace.cc:

	line_mixing_o2 -> line_mixing_data.
	line_mixing_o2_lut ->line_mixing_data_lut
	line_mixing_o2Read -> line_mixing_dataRead
	line_mixing_o2Init -> line_mixing_dataInit

	Change type of l_m_d to ArrayOfArrayOfVector. This way it can hold all
	the line mixing data for all species.

	Add argument species_tag to line_mixing_dataRead to specify to which
	abs_species this line mixing data should be attached to.

	* src/absorption.cc (find_matching_lines):

	If isotopologue index equals the total number of isotopologues in that
	species, it is also treated as a wildcard. Consistent with the
	behavior of SpeciesTag.

	* src/abs_species_tags.h (get_tagindex_for_Strings):

	Removed. Unused, no implementation present.

	* src/test_quantum.cc: Updated.

2013-04-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-594

	* src/absorption.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Fix parsing of v1 for O2. Add parsing of F'' for O2.

	* src/quantum.{h,cc}: Add quantum number F.

	* src/rational.cc (operator>>): Don't check for EINVAL.

	* src/m_linemixing.cc (line_mixing_o2Read): Add out3 info for matches.

2013-04-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-593

	* src/m_linemixing.cc (line_mixing_o2Read):

	Implement reading of line mixing data and matching it to lines in
	abs_lines_per_species. Needs more work in picking the right species.
	Currently just looks for the first O2 tag.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h} (find_matching_lines):

	Use -1 as wildcard for species and isotopologue. Add docs.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_linemixing.cc (line_mixing_o2Init): Added.

	* src/workspace.cc (line_mixing_o2_lut): Update docs.

	* src/test_quantum.cc: Updated.

2013-04-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-592

	* src/rational.{cc,h} (operator>>):

	Implement input operator for quantum numbers.

	* src/quantum.cc (operator<<): Prettier output with QN names.

	* src/absorption.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Parse upper/lower global quanta v1 value for O2.

	* src/test_quantum.cc: More tests.

2013-04-21  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-591

	* Introduced a "particles" abs_species, that takes the absorption
	properties from scat_data_raw and "vmr"s prom pnd_field. Note that this
	approach completely ignores scattering - both in extinction as well as
	in source part! Allows to consistently use the cloud/dust optical
	property data and density fields from arts-xml-data in non-scattering
	calcs (and only there!).
	The only change required for "usual" ARTS setups is when applying DOIT,
	iyEmissionStandard in the iy_main_agenda needs to get passed an empty
	dummy pnd_field.
	TO DO: Adapt documentation in AUG. Adapt abs_mat_fieldCalc.

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc:
	Adapted constructor and tag name extraction for new species "particles".

	* src/species_data.cc, partition_function_data.cc, abs_species_tags.h:
	Introduced species "particles" and type PARTICLES.

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(propmat_clearskyAddParticles): Introduced this method. Provides the
	propmat_clearsky for abs_species "particles" from scat_data_raw and
	rtp_pnd (taken from pnd_field).
	(abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc, propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc):
	Adapted for new abs_species "particles" and its type PARTICLES.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added rtp_pnd.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added rtp_pnd as input to propmat_clearsky_agenda.

	* src/rte.[cc,h]
	(get_ppath_atmvars): Added ppath_pnd as output, pnd_field and cloudbox_on
	as input, and functionality to calc ppath_pnd (only in case cloudbox_on
	is false).
	(get_ppath_abs): Added ppath_pnd as input and pass to
	propmat_clearsky_agenda.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Added pnd_field as input allowing
	to use in clear-sky absorption calculations (for abs_species "particle).
	Adapted	all calls of get_ppath_atmvars and get_ppath_abs accordingly.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc, m_cloudradar.cc, m_fos.cc (iyRadioLink,
	iyTransmissionStandard, iyCloudRadar, iyFOS):
	Adapted calls of get_ppath_atmvars and get_ppath_abs.

	* src/montecarlo.cc, disort.cc, doit.cc:
	Adapted all calls of propmat_clearsky_agenda passing a dummy rtp_pnd.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc
	(abs_lookupCalc, abs_speciesSet): Adapted for use with abs_species
	"particles".
	(abs_mat_fieldCalc): Temporarily adapted call of propmat_clearsky_agenda
	passing a dummy rtp_pnd.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (GasAbsLookup::Extract):
	Adapted for new type PARTICLES (no extraction for this. in analogy to
	FREE_ELECTRONS).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc):
	Added some pnd_field and "particles" abs_species related checks
	("particles" only allowed when cloudbox off; if cloudbox off &
	pnd_field set, then pnd_field needs to cover whole atmo AND "particles"
	need to be in abs_species).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc
	(ParticleTypeAdd, ParticleTypeAddAll): Removed any usage of
	cloudbox_limits.
	(pnd_fieldCalc): Allow empty cloudbox_limits assuming then pnd_field has
	to cover complete atmosphere (this facilitates the non-cloudbox usage of
	pnd_field for "particles" abs_species).

	* src/cloudbox.[cc,h] (chk_pnd_data, chk_pnd_raw_data): Removed check
	for all non-zero pnd values to be inside the cloudbox. Makes
	ParticleTypeAdd independent of the cloudbox definition, i.e. allows to
	get the particle data before defining the cloudbox (useful e.g. for
	auto-cloudbox detection). Check	is then anyway done by pnd_fieldCalc
	using chk_pnd_field_raw_only_in_cloudbox.

	* src/m_doit.cc, m_doit2.cc
	(CloudboxGetIncoming): Moved if (!cloudbox_on) to the very beginning.
	We don't need to do anything here, if cloudbox is off - not even
	checking that certain other checks were done.
	(CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm): As CloudboxGetIncoming. And added
	sensor_checked for consitency with CloudboxGetIncoming.
	(CloudboxGetIncoming2): Added sensor_checked for consitency with
	CloudboxGetIncoming.

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted to changes above.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/helpers/TestAgendaCopy.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/TestFaradayRotation.arts:
	Adapted propmat_clearsky_agenda definitions to ignore rtp_pnd.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts:
	Default set FlagOff( cloudbox_on ) and empty pnd_field.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts,
	doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	Pass empty dummy pnd_field into iyEmissionStandard (to avoid it trying
	to use the real, cloudbox-targeted pnd_field when called from
	CloudboxGetIncoming with a cloudbox_on=false flag)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloDataPrepare.arts,
	TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	Use named method parameters.

2013-04-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-590

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc):

	Increase spec index if a species is skipped (Zeeman / free_electrons).
	Otherwise the following species are stored in the wrong place.

2013-04-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-589

	* src/agendas.cc, src/methods.cc:

	doit_mono_agenda and doit_i_fieldSetClearsky defined doit_i_field as
	output only. This works fine if the all_frequencies flag is set to
	true (the default). However, if set to false, doit_i_field is resized
	when the first frequency is calculated. For the following frequencies,
	doit_mono_agenda is assuming that doit_i_field has already been
	resized, essentially misusing the output variable as an input.
	Nowadays, output-only variables are initialized to 0 to catch these
	cases of variable abuse.
	Hence, doit_i_field is now also defined as input for doit_mono_agenda
	and doit_i_fieldSetClearsky.
	Fixes bug reported by Patrick.

2013-04-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-588

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyFOS): A bit better handling of hgher stokes_dims.

2013-04-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-587

	* src/m_fos.cc (iyFOS): FOS restarted. So far just some kind of
	zero-order verson.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex (section{Practical usage}): Fixed typo,
	that check-all did not like.

	* src/make_array.h: Introduced array lengths 38 and 39. Turned out
	to be not needed right now, but kept anyhow.

	* src/doit.cc (rte_step_doit): rte_step_std renamed.

	* src/rte.cc (rte_step_std): Moved and renamed (see above).
	(emission_rtstep): New, dedicated for iyEmission.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Typo in a comment

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Remobed fos_i.

	* src/workspace.cc:
	* src/agendas.cc: Commented out all variables associated with FOS.

2013-04-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-586

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (propmat_clearskyAddZeeman):

	Check that abs_species and abs_lines_per_species match in size.

	* src/workspace.cc:

	Add line_mixing_o2 and line_mixing_o2_lut. Names might change.

	* src/methods.cc: Add line_mixing_o2Read.

	* src/src/m_linemixing.cc: New file. Only contains stub
	for line_mixing_o2Read.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add m_linemixing.cc.

2013-04-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-585

	* src/quantum.{h,cc}:

	Change internal storage class of Quantum Numbers from ArrayOfRational
	to a map. Saves memory and is also faster.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/yREFERENCE_3D.xml:

	Update references values to calculation results after richard's
	previous change.

	* src/absorption.cc (find_matching_lines): Return ret.

	* src/test_quantum.cc: Playing around.

2013-04-18  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-584

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Use the unDefined

	* src/lineshape.cc: Return to the previous way of doing Faddeeva.
	I personally think there is something fishy going on in how we use
	gamma and sigma in ARTS. I think there should be a more clear-cut
	definition and that names should change more often between the
	functions (e.g. be clear when gamma is self-broadening,
	Lorentz-broadening and/or collisional half-life).

	In any case, the Faddeeva function passes the standard clearsky
	test case and should therefore represent the Voigt shape quite
	well.

2013-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-583

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc):

	Initialize abs_lookup.xsec with NAN.

	Ignore free_electrons species.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (GasAbsLookup::Extract):

	Ignore species such as Zeeman and free_electrons which are not
	stored in the lookup table. For those the result is set to 0.

2013-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-582

	* src/xml_io_basic_types.cc:

	Use double_imanip() whenever reading a floating point number from an
	ASCII XML file. Allows proper reading of nan and inf values even if
	the compiler doesn't support it by default (such as gcc).

2013-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-581

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc (SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag(String def)):

	Initialize misotopologue with -1.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (GasAbsLookup::Adapt):

	species -> abs_species in chk_contains message.

2013-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-580

	* ChangeLog: Correct filename in previous entry.

2013-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-579

	* src/partition_function_data.cc:

	(define_partition_species_data): Add assertion at the end to ensure
	that all species have been taken care of. Add dummy entry for the
	free_electrons species.

	(spec, iso): Remove empty if statements that were just there to avoid
	an unused variable warning from the compiler when compiling without
	assertions. Instead, add _U_ in function parameter list to the variable
	that is only used in the assertion.

	* src/file.cc (open_input_file):

	Respect ARTS search path.

2013-04-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-578

	* src/rational.h: Tweak comparison operators. If the denominator is 0,
	the comparison is always false (except !=).

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Don't run testcases with 'nocheck' in their name automatically.

	This way we can have testcases defined that are currently broken /
	under construction without breaking 'make check' and still run them
	easily with ctest directly.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:

	Enable test_zeeman, add 'nocheck' to testcase name.

2013-04-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-577

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add test_quantum.

	* src/absorption.{h,cc} (LineRecord::ReadFromHitran2004Stream):

	Store quantum numbers for O2 in new QuantumNumberRecord.

	(find_matching_lines): Search in ArrayOfLineRecord.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (propmat_clearskyAddZeeman):

	Use quantum numbers from the QuantumNumberRecord.

	* src/rational.h:

	Define RATIONAL_UNDEFINED and add isUndefined method.

	* src/quantum.{cc,h}:

	Add Compare function and simple output operators.

	Remove QUANTUM_UNDEFINED and use new RATIONAL_UNDEFINED instead.

2013-04-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-576

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_basic)
	(raytrace_2d_linear_basic, raytrace_3d_linear_basic): With
	ppath_lmax=-1, lmax was effectively set lraytrace and number of
	path points could differ between geometric and refraction calcs.
	Expanded an if-statement, to solve this problem.

2013-04-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-575

	* src/arts.h: Add define for isnan an isinf to fix compilation on
	g++ (>=4.7) using the new c++11 standard.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/yREFERENCE_3D.xml:

	Update reference file.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/TestZeeman.arts: Remove abs_n2.

	* src/m_extract.h: Update docs for Extract template function.

2013-04-15  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-574

	* src/m_extract.h (Extract): Removed Extract for Index from ArrayOfIndex
	as this - according to Oliver - is implicitly included in the template
	function.

2013-04-15  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-573

	* src/m_extract.h (Extract): Added Extract for Index from ArrayOfIndex.

	* src/m_doit.cc

	(CloudboxGetIncoming, iyInterpCloudboxField): Introduce sanity check for
	radiance field interpolation - throws an error if radiance ratio between
	two interpolation points exceeds a threshold. Can be switched off (and
	old non-check behaviour used instead, which is preferable for very thin
	atmospheres, where radiance field is a step function when going from
	downlooking to limb) via "rigorous" keyword. Only for 1D case
	implemented, though.

	(doit_za_grid_optCalc): Throw level-1 warning instead of runtime error
	if number of zenith angles for grid optimizations seems too low (<500).

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted to the changes in WSM above.

	* src/doit.[cc,h] (iy_interp_cloudbox_field): Sanity check for radiance
	field interpolation (see iyInterpCloudboxField above).

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Minor fix: in 3D allow sensor to
	be right on the edge of the defined lon-grid.

	* src/continua.cc
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScen_Mars.arts:
	Minor spellfixes.

	* doc/uguide/gridded_field_gridnames.txt: Some more specifications.

2013-04-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-572

	* src/quantum.{cc,h}: Quantum numbers implementation. Unfinished.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:

	Rename QuantumNumbers to QuantumNumbersString. Will be removed once
	the new implementation is completed.

	Add QuantumNumberRecord to LineRecord.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Add quantum.cc.

	* src/rational.{cc,h}:

	Remove assertion for denom>0 (for now). Because we want to use
	Rational(0,0) as an undefined value.

	Use less controversial names for  member
	variables. top -> mnom, low -> mdenom.

2013-04-10  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-571

	* src/m_abs.cc, src/absorption.h (linesElowToJoule):

	controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsua.arts :
	Added preliminary testcases for AMSU-A type sensor 

2013-04-09  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-569

	* src/methods.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Added input variable
	*abs_f_interp_order*.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): If any of the wind
	fields exist, abs_f_interp_order must not be zero. This to make
	sure that absorption lookup table extraction still works if the
	frequency grid is Doppler shifted.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/groundbased/TestWinds.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Jupiter.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Venus.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScenSup_Mars.arts:
	Set abs_f_interp_order to 1 to avoid runtime error.

2013-04-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-568

	* README: Cleanup TESTS section. Fix factual error: clang does NOT

2013-04-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-567

	* src/docserver.cc (Docserver::doc_method):

	Instead of listing variables that are used both as input and output
	twice, just list them once and mark them with 'OUT+IN'.

2013-04-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-566

	* src/workspace.cc: Remove abs_species_lookup and abs_species_onthefly.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_abs_lookup.cc (SpeciesPartitionLookupOnthefly):

	Removed.

2013-04-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-565

2013-04-05  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-564

	* src/absorption.cc: Fix HITRAN reading routine for species without 
	isotopologues.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestCIA.arts: Fix what previous commit
	broke.

2013-04-05  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-563
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Returned to not having a phase xsec. Also added
	extra commentary to isotopologue_quantum.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Removed reference to line mixing. LM will be
	handeled internally in xsec_species in the future.
	
	* src/methods.cc,src/m_abs.cc,src/agendas.cc: Returned to not having
	a phase xsec explicitly for functions that don't care about it.
	(xsec_species) still return the phase variable because functions like
	m_zeeman require the phase.
	
	* src/lineshapes.cc: Fixed major bug in treatment of pressure
	broadening in (faddeeva_algorithm_916). We treat the pressure
	broadening parameter as half width half strength, not full width half
	strength. So to get the necessary parameter for the Faddeeva function,
	gamma should thus be divided by 2PI and nothing else. This might have
	to be clarified in the related paper, but it does not change the
	results in there the slightest, since the related paper is clearly in
	the temperature region of atmospheric broadening.

2013-03-31  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-562

	* src/cia.{cc,h}:

	(cia_get_index): Fix critical bug. ArrayOfCIARecord was accidentally
	passed in by value instead of reference, causing horrible slowdown in
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA due to copying of all CIA species data on
	every call in inner loop.
	Single-threaded CIA calculations now 5x faster, multi-threaded (8 cores)
	20x faster than before.

	(cia_interpolation): Only create out3 output if needed.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_interpolation_grids):

	Only create ostringstream if needed.

	* src/m_cia.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA):

	Got rid of one unnecessary ostringstream in the inner loop.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Set COMPILE_FLAGS just before creating config.h. Otherwise arts -v
	might not show the correct flags.

	Remove NDEBUG from CMAKE_C*_FLAGS earlier.

2013-03-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-561

	* absorption.{cc,h}:

	(LineRecord): Add member mquantum_numbers.

	(LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Read quantum numbers into string.

	(LineRecord::operator<<):

	Do not write quantas from Hitran into ARTSCAT-4. They are incompatible

	from the original ARTSCAT-4 file (if this LineRecord has them).

2013-03-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-560

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (ParticleTypeInit):

	Do a resize(0) instead of a reserve(20) because the latter does not do
	any initialization. This is required behaviour of Init methods.

	* arts.h (DEBUG_PRINT): Add convenience macro for debugging to cerr.

	DEBUG_PRINT(x) outputs DBG: x: 1

	Can be used with expressions too: DEBUG_PRINT(x+1) outputs DBG: x+1: 2

	* src/m_general.{cc,h}, src/methods.cc:

	Fix behaviour of timer WSV. Instead of outputting the timer values
	inside the timerStop method, move that implementation to Print.

2013-03-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-559

	* src/m_doit.cc (DoitInit):

	Throw runtime_error if scat_za_grid is not increasing. Fixes assertion
	in doit_scat_fieldCalcLimb reported by Jana.

	Fix typo in the scat_aa_grid runtime error (s/za/aa/).

2013-03-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* WARNING! This version requires you to adapt your controlfiles:

	Replace SpeciesSet with abs_speciesSet!

	Insert abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc and
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc where needed.

	I recommend to always call abs_speciesSet, abs_speciesAdd and
	abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario by keyword:
	
	Use abs_speciesSet( species=["CO2"] ) instead of
	abs_speciesSet( abs_species, ["CO2"] ).

	Same for abs_speciesAdd and DefineAllScenarios:

	abs_speciesAdd( species=["H2O"] )
	abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario( basename="testdata/tropical" )

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_abs.cc, src/m_abs_lookup.cc:

	(abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc, propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc):

	Two new checks that have to be called before abs_xsec_agenda or
	propmat_clearsky_agenda are used. They ensure that the two agendas
	contain the required methods to satisfy calculation of all tags set in
	abs_species.

	(abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario, abs_speciesAdd, abs_speciesAdd2):

	Add propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked and abs_xsec_agenda_checked as
	output.

	(propmat_clearskyInit): Add propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked as input.

	(abs_xsec_per_speciesInit): Add abs_xsec_agenda_checked as input.

	(abs_speciesSet):
	Change abs_species output type from generic to specific and rename the
	function accordingly.
	In almost all cases this method is called with abs_species. By
	changing it to a specific output, it can be left out in the call. The
	rare case of setting abs_nls directly can be easily done by calling:

	abs_speciesSet( abs_species=abs_nls, species=["H2O-PWR98"] )

	* src/agenda_class.{cc,h} (Agenda::has_method): Added.

	* src/workspace.cc:

	Add abs_xsec_agenda_checked and propmat_clearsky_agenda_checked.
	
	* src/abs_species_tags.cc (get_tagindex_for_Strings): Removed.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex: SpeciesSet -> abs_speciesSet.

	* controlfiles/*/*/*.arts:

	Use keywords in SpeciesSet, abs_speciesAdd and
	abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario.
	
	Insert abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc,
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc where needed.

	* Quite a big absorption part overhaul. Not completely finished,
	there will be some polishing in the next days. All check-all
	targets run (except for something with the userguide that was
	already broken). I did not try to fix other controlfiles that are
	not part of check-all. In generally, just including the following
	should make your controlfile work again:

	# Agenda for scalar gas absorption calculation
	Copy(abs_xsec_agenda, abs_xsec_agenda__noCIA)

	* src/absorption.h (abs_n2Set, abs_h2oSet): Moved declarations
	here, since these are no longer WSMs.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h (GasAbsLookup): Updated friend function declarations.

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(abs_h2oSet): Removed fancy treatment if no H2O is found. Instead,
	throw runtime error directly, just as abs_n2Set does.
	(abs_coefCalc): Removed this method, which is no longer needed.
	(abs_coefCalcSaveMemory): Ditto.
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesInit, abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines)
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts): Added input variable
	abs_species_active to all of these methods. Absorption is
	calculated only for the active species. (This feature is needed
	when abs_xsec_agenda is executed for absorption lookup table generation.)
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts): Now set h2o_abs and n2_abs
	internally (using the dedicated helper functions).
	(abs_mat_per_speciesAddOnTheFly): Use new agenda
	abs_xsec_agenda. Removed input variables that are specific to
	certain absorption methods, such as the	line list,
	etc.. Eliminated call of abs_coefCalc.

	* src/m_cia.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA): Added input variable
	abs_species_active. Absorption is calculated only for the active
	species.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_coefCalc, abs_coefCalcSaveMemory)
	(abs_h2oSet, abs_n2Set): Eliminated these WSMs.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc
	(abs_lookupCalc): Use new agenda
	abs_xsec_agenda, which considerably simplifies things. Removed
	input variables that are specific to certain absorption methods,
	such as line list, continuum models, etc..
	(calc_lookup_error, abs_lookupTestAccuracy, abs_lookupTestAccMC):
	Use new agenda abs_xsec_agenda.

	* src/agendas.cc (abs_xsec_agenda): Added input variable
	abs_species_active.

	* src/workspace.cc (abs_h2o, abs_n2): Eliminated these WSVs.

	* controlfiles/*: Added
	Copy(abs_xsec_agenda, abs_xsec_agenda__noCIA)
	to most controlfiles. Removed calls of abs_h2oSet and abs_n2Set.

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake:

	Raise the report level for test cases from -r002 to -r022.
	Then one can see useful information on the screen when manually
	running testcases with, e. g. 'ctest -V -R fast.faraday'

	* src/messages.h:

	(sufficient_priority_agenda): Move the in_main_agenda check into here.

	(sufficient_priority): New method. Returns true if current output
	priority is sufficient for either screen or file.

	(ArtsOut::operator<<): Remove in_main_agenda check.

	* src/absorption.cc (calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4):

	Correct output value to vmrs[this_species]+broad_spec_vmr_sum in
	warning.

	Use out2.sufficient_priority().

	* src/arts.h: Add convenience macro DEBUG_COUNTER(n). This will create
	a static variable and output the name of the counter and its value
	everytime that code is reached.

2013-03-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-536

	* src/absorption.cc (calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4):

	Only send the warning about the total VMR being more than 10% different
	from 1. to out2 if the user can actually see it (verbosity>=2).
	Speeds up arts.ctlfile.xmldata.surf.mars by a factor of 2 because the
	warning happens 11.8 million times. This output is unlikely to be ever
	seen because it only appears inside an agenda. Only running arts
	with -r202 will make this warning visible (and produce a 1.3 GB rep
	file). I think we'll have to rethink our logging strategy.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupSetupWide) Set all plain VMRs

	* arts-2-1-529

	* Having fun with compiler bugs.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans):

	The OpenMP loops in this function fail randomly with GCC on Mac OS X.
	This appears to be a compiler bug. The code looks fine and they work
	fine with GCC on Linux and with the Intel Compiler on Mac.
	Also tested to remove the OpenMP statements from our loops and instead
	add a dummy OpenMP loop that does nothing. This still leads to crashes
	which indicates there's nothing wrong with our loops but with the
	compiler implementation. Apple GCC 4.2 works fine but self-compiled
	GCC 4.4, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8dev all experiences this issue.
	Added #if !(__APPLE__) || (__INTEL_COMPILER) for those loops.

	* Fix compilation with the Intel Compiler (tested with 12.1.0, 13.0.1):

	* src/m_xml.{h.cc}:

	Move non-template implementations into new .cc file.

	* src/absorption.cc:

	Always make species_data visible as const.

	* src/absorption.cc, src/m_abs_lookup.cc, src/m_batch.cc,
	src/m_doit.cc, src/m_rte.cc:

	Workaround for Intel Compiler (13.0.1) OpenMP issue. Loops that use
	firstprivate variables segfault if the number of iterations is 0. The
	Intel Compiler correctly skips the loop in that case, but still tries
	to call the destructors of the variables defined as firstprivate which
	haven't even been created in this scenario.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs):

	Workaround for Intel Compiler (13.0.1) optimization bug. Remove the
	continue statement from within the catch block. Otherwise compilation
	will never finish.

	* src/m_abs.cc, src/m_ppath.cc: Include m_xml.h for WriteXML.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream<SpeciesAuxData>):

	Initialize n to 0 to avoid compiler warning.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Use set_source_files_properties for all compilers.

	Add m_xml.cc to artscore.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Add compiler flags -fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestIsoRatios.arts,
	IsoRatios_H2Oorig.xml, IsoRatios_H2Omani.xml:
	Fixed isoratio test case (broken by slightly changed requirements on
	which isoratios have to be present).

2013-02-27  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-525

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScen_Mars.arts,

	Bugfix (get data from arts-xml-data, not from Jana's homedir!).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Mars.arts:
	Removed leftover Print calls.

2013-02-27  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-524

	* CMakeLists.txt: Introduced a target check-xmldata (which does exactly
	that - executing the arts-xml-data tests) and adapted make check setup
	such that xmldata tests are NOT executed with this one.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:
	Introduced further tests, particular xmldata tests.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/helpers/TestForloop.arts, TestHSE.arts,
	TestRegridding.arts, TestAgendaCopy.arts:
	Added. Tests of some ARTS helper methods.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestIsoRatios.arts,
	TestSpectro*.arts, spectrotest.py:
	Added. Tests of toolbox spectroscopic and isotopologue ratio data.
	CAUTION: TestSpectro*.arts require HITRAN data, hence are not included
	in the make check target. Also, they need quite a bit of runtime.
	Nevertheless, they are part of the ESA planetary toolbox test cases,
	hence we want to have them in the repository.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestRefractPlanets.arts:
	Added. Testing MWgeneral refraction method.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestAtmScen*.arts,

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Now takes manual angles given the right GIN. Useful with
	Oliver's named argument implementation to make simplistic magnetic field 
	calculations without having to recompile the code or having to specifically
	customize the magnetic field.
	
	* src/methods.cc: manual_zeeman_angles_on, manual_zeeman_theta and
	manual_zeeman_eta are added as GIN to abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeeman.
	The first is a tag that will set eta and theta to the other two accordingly.

	* New controlfile feature: Named arguments!

	Besides calling a workspace method with positional arguments, it is now
	possible to use named arguments. Omitted arguments will be set to
	their defaults. For specific inputs/outputs the default WSV will be
	used and for generic in/out the default value.

	For example, calling a method with all the default arguments and only
	pass in two custom values for the generic input required this code
	before:

	doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D(
	          doit_i_field, doit_scat_field, cloudbox_limits,
	          abs_mat_per_species_agenda, vmr_field, spt_calc_agenda,
	          scat_za_grid, scat_aa_grid, pnd_field, opt_prop_part_agenda,
	          ppath_step_agenda, ppath_lraytrace, p_grid, z_field,
	          refellipsoid, t_field, edensity_field, f_grid, f_index,
	          surface_rtprop_agenda, doit_za_interp,
	          1, 0.05 )
	
	now one can simply write:

	doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D( normalize=1,
	                         norm_error_threshold=0.05 )
	
	* src/parser.{h,cc}: Add named argument support.

	* src/sourcetext.h (SourceText):

	Add new member functions LineRaw, ColumnRaw and SetPosition.

	* src/methods.cc:

	Make generic input/output variables names more consistent. Generic
	output in ...Set... WSMs is called 'out', generic input that is usually
	given as a literal is called 'value' (e.g. in VectorSet or
	MatrixSetConstant), otherwise 'in'.

	Add docs for FieldFromGriddedField.

	Set default value for userparam to [] in abs_cont_descriptionAppend.

	* controlfiles/general/continua.arts,
	controlfiles/general/general.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts:

	Updated to use named arguments.

	* doc/uguide/concept.tex: Add paragraph about named arguments.

	* Doppler shift now also included in call of
	blackbody_radiation_agenda, as well as when calculating particle
	extinction. However, for efficiency reasons, for particles only
	the mean shift along the path is considered. This as it is time
	consuming to extract the data from scat_data_raw. So this is done
	assuming a constant shift along the path. This allows to at least
	include big shifts caused by e.g. satellite velocity. The smaller
	shifts are here of less importance as the particle extinction is
	quite smooth with frequency.

	* doc/uguide/winds.tex: Chapter revised.

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex (section{Wind and magnetic vector fields}):
	* doc/uguide/rte.tex (section{Dispersion}): Some smaller changes
	related to revision of the Doppler chapter.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/groundbased/TestGbased.arts: Removed
	some obselete stuff related to jacobians.

	* doc/uguide/matrix_vector.tex: Added that the mean function is
	defined for vector and matrix. Also added a small note that min.
	max and mean for matrices is for the complete matrix.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestIsoRatios.arts:
	Changed rte_ to rtp_, where necessary.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard, iyRadioLink):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Adopted to changes in rte.cc.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_f): get_ppath_doppler renamed, as now
	shifted f_grid is returned, and not only the shift.

	(get_ppath_abs): Temporary solution for rtp_doppler, until
	settled how to handle frequency shifts for abslookup.

	(get_ppath_blackrad,get_ppath_ext): Now takes ppath_f as input.

	* Treatment of Doppler shifts streamlined. Now possible to include
	sensor movement (but so far only on iyCalc level), and prepared
	for frequency dependent shift.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioOccultation.arts:
	Adopted call of iyRadioLink.

	* src/make_array.h: Had to add define MakeArray for 37 arguments.
	(iyRadioLink appearently has this record for input arguments).

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard, iyRadioLink):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard):
	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Adopted to changes below.
	And now also taking rte_alonglos_v as input (passed on to
	get_ppath_doppler).

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_xxxx): Now winds and mag-field stored as
	vectors even for ppath_wind and ppath_mag.
	(get_ppath_doppler): New. Returns frequency dependent Doppler shift.
	(calc_doppler): Removed (replaced by function above).
	(get_ppath_abs): Now using ppath_doppler.

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc:

	Bug fix: Workspace method parameters that are defined to be
	exclusively used as output are initialized to a specific values in
	debug mode. Due to the bug, always the default variable was
	initialized, not the variable that was actually passed to the WSM,
	e.g.:

	IndexCreate(i)
	AtmosphereSet1D(i, lat_grid, lon_grid)
	Print(i)
	Print(atmosphere_dim)

	This code should throw an error in the 2nd Print statement that
	atmosphere_dim is uninitialized. Instead, although i was initialized
	correctly to 1, also atmosphere_dim was set to -1.

	Added initialization code for Tensor4-7.

2013-02-21  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-515

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromSplitArtscat): Use
	SpeciesTag::Type() to decide on type of species tag.

	* src/absorption.cc (checkIsotopologueRatios): Rewritten. Use
	abs_species only to decide what species to check. For the check
	itself, rely only on the built in species data and the external
	isotopologue ratio data.

	* src/species_data.cc: Corrected outdated H2O comment.

	* src/agendas.cc (abs_xsec_per_species_agenda):
	Added. Name may still change.

	* src/workspace.cc (abs_xsec_per_species_agenda): Added. Name may

	longitude end, with 360 deg lon-coverage, failed. Found be
	Richard. This special case now fixed. Fixed also the parallel case
	of nadir measurements exactly at the North pole. (No change should
	be required for lower lon end and South pole.)

	Note that nadir measurements exactly at end points are in gernal
	not allowed. But the two cases above are exceptions.

	* Quite a lot of changes, but should for most simulations not
	require any changes of your cfile. The exception is of you define
	some agendas without using the pre-defined ones. You can then need
	to change some rte_xyz to rtp_xyz. Ask me if you are in doubt.

	Adopted to new WSV names.

	* src/methods.cc: Adopted to WSV changes below + fixed some
	incorrect doc-text.

	* src/workspace.cc: Tried to introduce a clearer distinction
	between variables defining a calculation to solve the radiative
	transfer equation (rte_xyz), and variables at a point along the
	path needed to calculate radiative transfer properties (rtp_xyz).
	"rtp" can also stand for radiative transfer point, select the full
	name you prefer
	This means that several variables before starting with rte now
	starts with rtp, for example, we now have rtp_temperature. Note
	that ppath_los is renamed to rtp_los for consistency.

	Totally new WSV: rte_alonglos_v, rtp_pos

	In addition, rte_vmr_list renamed to rtp_abs_species

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species): Returns both phase and
	attenuation line shape. This halves the time spent in line shape
	functions for Zeeman and it is in preparation for the addition of
	first order line mixing (which still will require an additional
	database).

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans): Halves the time spent on Faraday
	rotation for special cases by moving matrix definition and adding
	parallellisation.

	* src/m_abs.cc,m_abs_lookup.cc (several places): Changed to allow
	for phase and attenuation shapes. Also prepared for line mixing.

	* src/workspace.cc: abs_lineshape_zeeman_phase is now gone.
	abs_xsec_per_species is replaces by abs_xsec_per_species_attenuation and
	abs_xsec_per_species_phase.

	* src/lineshapes.cc: Line shapes now accept and returns a phase
	line shape. Only algorithm 916 returns phase so far.

	* src/absorption.h,m_abs_lookup.cc: Changed necessary parts.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioOccultation.arts:
	Changed as cfile below.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts: Last
	commit gave error for this test, on Hudson. I also tried three
	different platform/compiler combinations and got three different
	results! (though one looked to match Hudson). My only conclusion
	is that compiler differences give slightly different link paths,
	which cause significant errors for the estimation of defocusing.
	The bending angle sensitivity to the compiler differences seems to
	be below 1e-4 deg, but this is not sufficient!

	Now changed to a shorter ray tracing length. And using second
	defocus method (that appears to be more stable). Relative
	difference for defocus between compilers seems to be about 0.5%
	with these settings. High to be just a compiler issue, but OK.

	* src/methods.cc (iyRadioLink): Changed default for defocus_shift
	to 1e-3. Old value too low considering the problems discussed above.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/TestFaradayRotation.arts:
	Sharpened the compare accuracy for the rotation part.

	* arts-2-1-491

	* src/m_cia.cc (abs_cia_dataReadFromCIA):

	Check both combinations for the two CIA species when looking for input
	files (e.g. Ar-CH4.cia and CH4-Ar.cia).

2013-02-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-490

	* src/abs_species_tags.cc (SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag(String def)):
	Fixed runtime error message when second species is unknown.

	* src/species_data.cc: Added species Ar, which is needed for
	HITRAN CIA continua.

	* src/partition_function_data.cc: Added species Ar, which is needed for
	HITRAN CIA continua.

2013-02-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-489

	* Bug fixed in N2-CIAfunCKDMT100 continuum reported by Josef Gasteiger.
	This indexing bug caused wrong values of different magnitude depending
	on frequency range, operating system and compiler version.

	* src/continua.cc:

	(XINT_FUN): Add second implementation that takes a ConstVectorView as
	input.

	(CKD_mt_CIArot_n2): Replace C-type Numeric arrays with Vectors to
	enable boundary checks.

	(CKD_mt_CIAfun_n2): Replace C-type Numeric arrays with Vectors to
	enable boundary checks.

	Fix array-index-out-of-bounds access by extending the size of the
	coefficient array k by one 0-value.

	* Bounds-checking for the other continua will be added next to see if
	any of them are affected by similar bugs.

2013-02-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-488

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: Chapter revised and updated. Now
	synced with the source code.

	* doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt: transmission.tex was not included.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/farrot_totalREFERENCE.xml:
	Converted data from rad to deg.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex (section{Practical usage}): Units
	updated, follwoing the changes below.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard, iyRadioLink):
	Changed output unit for Faraday rotation variables fro rad to deg.
	This to be consistent with the fact that degrees is used elsewhere
	for input and output angles.
	That is, we are not using the SI unit for angles (but better being
	consistent, than partly doing this) !!!

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans): Fixed bad spelling in header text.

	* src/methods.cc: Wrote on-line doc for iyRadioLink. Updated text
	for ppathFromRtePos2.

2013-02-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-487

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_general_sub): Now also returning
	radiative background.
	(defocusing_general): Now also handling the case if the lower of the
	calculations hits the ground.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink2.arts:
	Adopted to change below.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Now "method 1" is the more
	general defocus algorithm. Realised that size of some aux vars
	could be made even more compact. Also started to write
	documentation in methods.cc.

2013-02-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-486

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_general): Now taking dza from calling
	function (before hard-coded).

	(defocusing_sat2sat): As above + fixed error in calculation
	(impact paramater was mixed up with geometrical ztan) + now not
	crashes if any of the two extra calculations hits the surface.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Made angular shift to use
	for defoc-calculations a method input.

2013-02-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-485

	* src/xml_io_array_types.cc, src/xml_io_compound_types.cc,
	src/xml_io_instantiation.h, src/xml_io_types.h:

	Implement XML reading/writing of CIARecord and ArrayOfCIARecord.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_cia.cc:

	Add abs_cia_dataReadFromXML. Reads CIA data from XML file and checks
	that all CIA species from abs_species are defined in that file.

	* src/cia.h (CIARecord):

	Change runtime errors to assertions in getters.

	Add getter for const reference to mdata.

	Be friend with xml_read_from_stream.

2013-02-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-484

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Fixed and tuned the criterion
	for determining that a ground-intersection is found (there was a

2013-02-01  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-483

	* src/species_data.cc (H): Added missing species H, needed for CIA
	continua.

	* src/partition_function_data.cc (H): Ditto.

2013-02-01  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-482

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Mars.arts:
	Added. Data testing controlfile for Mars surface data.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/TestSurf_Earth.arts:
	Polished that one (testing of Earth surface characterization data) a
	little.

	* arts-2-1-480

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (GriddedFieldLatLonRegrid):

	Fix copy/paste error in loop for GriddedField4.

2013-01-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-479

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Made a small change that
	should allow the sensor longitude and lon_grid to have different
	lon-ranges. For example, a lon_grid between -100 and 0 and a sensor
	longitude of 310 should now work. Before it was a bit random if
	such cases were OK or not, as pointed out by Jana. (Not heavily
	tested, I leave this to Jana!)

2013-01-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-478

	* controlfiles/general/planet_earth.arts:
	* controlfiles/general/planet_venus.arts:
	* controlfiles/general/planet_mars.arts:
	* controlfiles/general/planet_jupiter.arts: g0_agenda now defined
	locally.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Removed all definitions of
	g0_agenda-s. This to make the planet files totally independent of
	this file.

2013-01-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-477

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): My fix yesterday was not
	OK. The call of resolve_lon now made at an earler stage. 

2013-01-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-476

	* src/logic.{cc,h} (is_lon_cylic):

	New function to check for a cyclic longitude grid.

	* src/interpolation_poly.cc: Use new is_lon_cyclic.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (GriddedFieldLatLonRegrid):

	Check that data values at 0 and 360 degrees agree in cyclic lon grids.

2013-01-29  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-475

	* src/m_cia.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA): Throw runtime error
	if VMR of second species in CIA collision pair does not
	exist. (Instead of simply crashing.)

2013-01-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-474

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): The last point of the
	steps was not passed through resolve_lon.
	(Jana, the case you sent now runs OK.)

2013-01-29  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-473

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Downgraded missing-H2O-error to
	a warning (when no H2O tag setting h2o_vmr=0. of course.). Deviations
	between including and excluding H2O in tropical atmo are <30m for
	z<100km and <50m for z<1500km (so, H2O not that relevant at all :-O ).

	* src/[m_basic_types,methods].cc (Compare): Added Tensor3 capability.

2013-01-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-472

	* src/interpolation_poly.cc (gridpos_poly_longitudinal):

	Add missing call to chk_interpolation_grids for the case when the lons
	don't have to be shifted. Fixes bug reported by Jana.

2013-01-29  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-471

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/arts-xml-data/*.arts:
	Added. Controlfiles for testing the data (format, functionality on
	rather crude level, ...). Currently restricted to data added for the
	planetary toolbox. For the moment includes tests of basic and suppl. atm
	fields data for all 4 planets, surface fields for earth; more to come).
	Currently not part of a check target (but shall become, once a target
	for cases applying arts-xml-data package is created - Oliver!?!)

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts:
	Another predefined surface agenda added (lambertian refl. with
	surface_skin_t from t_field).

	* src/[methods,workspace].cc: some spellfixes.

2013-01-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-470

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): The setting of iy_aux for
	"fatal" cases did not work.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): More stringent check of iy_aux_array.

2013-01-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-469

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Adopted definition of
	ppath_agenda__TransmitterReceiverPath.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Now switched to use new version
	of the method. (Old version deleted)

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Now also accepting "unvalid"
	ppaths. This gives iy=NaN.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_set_background,ppath_what_background):
	Defined string for case 0 to be "unvalid" (before just "").

	* src/lin_alg.cc: Added type casting where dividing with an integer
	number.

2013-01-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink2.arts:
	Adopted call of iyRadioLink.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: ppath_lraytarce now set (to 1
	km).

	(cloud_ppath_update3D):
	* src/m_ppath.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Adopted calls of ppath_agenda
	and ppath_step agenda. Had to add ppath_lraytrace as input to most
	of the functions.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added ppath_lraytrace as input to ppath_agenda
	and ppath_step agenda, to allow algorithms to adjust this
	variable.

	* src/lin_alg.cc (linreg): Made a bit more robust regarding
	numerical problems, by instead making fit for x' = (x-mean(x)).

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Impact parameter now set through
	ppath.constant. Now also handling the case of surface
	intersections (iy retiunred as 0 and iy_aux empty).

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Improved description of ppath.constant,
	and fixed dead section reference.

2013-01-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-468

	* src/lin_alg.cc (linreg): Created.

2013-01-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-467

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2V2): Trying to make a better
	version of the method. Not yet reached the critical part.

2013-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-466

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyRadioLink): Added impact parameter as
	aux variable.

2013-01-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-465

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmRawRead):

	Bug fix. Resize vmr_field_raw to 0 before starting to append to it.

	* src/cia.cc (CIARecord::AppendDataset):

	Fix temperature grid index.

2013-01-22  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-464

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_field, chk_atm_surface):
	Replaced all checks for fabs(a-b)>0 (in checking constancy at poles and
	cyclicity at longitudes) by is_same_within_epsilon(a,b,2*DBL_EPSILON) to
	avoid number accuracy issues.

	* src/logic.cc (is_same_within_epsilon): Minor bug fix (correct handling
	of negative numbers)

	* src/methods.cc,workspace.cc: Cosmetics.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Cosmetics.

2013-01-21  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-463

	* src/cia.{h,cc}: Introduced robust option for CIA extraction. If
	set to 1, then being outside the temperature range of the data
	will not give a runtime error, only return NAN. The default is 0,
	which means that there will be a runtime error.

	* src/m_cia.cc: Ditto.

	* src/test_cia.cc: Adapted to robust option.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA): Added the robust option.

	* src/m_basic_types.h (nelemGet): Implemented for group ArrayOfArrayOfSpeciesTag.

2013-01-21  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-462

	* src/cia.cc (cia_interpolation): Fixed (last?) bug. Validation ongoing.

	* src/matpackI.cc
	(VectorView::operator MatrixView): Cosmetic changes to my fix from
	last Friday.
	(ConstVectorView::operator ConstMatrixView): Ditto.

	* src/test_matpack.cc (test42): Expanded the test.

2013-01-21  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

2013-01-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-460

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky2.arts:
	Corrected header text. Last ChangeLog message for this file is
	wrong. This file tests particularly ySimpleSpectrometer.

2013-01-18  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-459

	* src/cia.{h,cc}: Debugging. But the CIA data as read from the
	HITRAN files right now seem strange: Mostly negative values!
	Perhaps still a bug in the reading routine?

	* src/m_cia.cc: Cosmetics.

	* src/matpackI.cc
	(VectorView::operator MatrixView): This function
	contained a bug that was triggered in the case that the original
	VectorView had a non-zero start. Fixed now.
	(ConstVectorView::operator ConstMatrixView): Ditto.

	* src/test_matpack.cc (test42): Test the matpack bugfixes.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestCIA.arts: Work in progress.

2013-01-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-458

	* src/cia.cc (CIARecord::ReadFromCIA):

	Reuse istringstream. Better input error checking.

	* src/methods.cc: Update docs for CIAInfo.

2013-01-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-457

	* src/cia.{h,cc}:

	(CIARecord::ReadFromCIA): Fix bug in parsing.

	(DatasetCount, TemperatureGrid, FrequencyGrid, Dataset):

	New members for CIARecord to access the datasets.

	* src/m_cia, src/methods.cc: Add CIAInfo. Remove abs_cia_dataInit.

2013-01-18  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-456

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.cc (Extract): Implemented feature requested
	by Jana: Throw a runtime error if one of the reference VMR
	profiles is zero, but abs_vmrs is not. (This means that the lookup
	table was calculated with a reference profile of zero for that
	gas.) Not yet tested, since I don't have a suitable test case.

2013-01-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-455

	* src/abs_species_tags.{h,cc} (SpeciesTag):

	mcia -> mcia_second, Cia() -> CIASecond, CiaDataset -> CIADataset

	* src/cia.{h,cc}

	(cia_get_index): Helper to find index in CIA data.

	(Extract): Add parameter dataset index. Use index instead of loop.

	* src/m_cia (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA, abs_cia_dataReadFromCIA):

	Adapt for changed type of abs_cia_data.

	* src/nc_io_types.h, src/xml_io_instantiation.h, src/xml_io_types.h,
	src/workspace.cc, src/nc_io_array_types.cc, src/xml_io_array_types.cc,
	src/groups.cc:

	Change type of abs_cia_data to ArrayOfCIARecord.

	Remove ArrayOfArrayOfCIARecord as a group and add ArrayOfCIARecord
	instead.

2013-01-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-454

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioOccultation.arts:
	Missed to do svn add on the file.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Init ip to dummy value of -999,
	to avoid compiler warning. And changed defualt for dl_ok to 0.5.
	Seems to cover the worst case for TestRadioOccultation.arts (tried
	500 angles).

2013-01-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-453

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioOccultation.arts:
	A control file simulating a complete occultation.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): The method now operates with a
	target and OK level for the "miss distance". This to allow for
	aimimg at a high acccuracy but not getting an error directly when
	that accuracy can not be achived. To achieve this, variables and
	code added so that the previous ppath can be selected as the solution.

	* src/methods.cc: Some further polishing of the text for Append.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (TangentPointPrint): Extended the output somewhat.

2013-01-17  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-452

	* src/abs_species_tags.{h,cc}
	(SpeciesTag::CiaDataset): Added this function (and associated
	private member) to store the index of the dataset to use (inside
	the CIA file), which is also now appended at the end of the CIA
	species tag.
	(SpeciesTag::SpeciesTag): Parse also the new dataset index at the
	end of the CIA tag. It must be present!
	(SpeciesTag::Name): Fixed broken CIA tag name output. Not testet!

	* src/cia.{h,cc}
	(cia_interpolation): Continued to work on this.

	* src/m_cia.cc: Cosmetics.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestCIA.arts: Updated for new
	CIA tag names with dataset index.

2013-01-17  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-451

	* licenses/*: Added various license agreements to this folder so
	that it is clear what code is reusable with ARTS.

	* src/lineshapes.cc: Added Algorithm 916 (see code for details) to
	calculate the Faddeeva function. The Faddeeva function offers a
	solution to both the Voigt and Faraday-Voigt lineshapes. The
	current implementation is very slow, as it calculates the line shapes
	twice even though one calculation is mathematically sufficient. I
	suggest a complex_xsec function returning two vectors in a future
	update instead of returning the real and complex values as separate
	line shapes. The line shapes were tested within the limit of the
	Zeeman model paper and deemed OK.

	* src/Faddeeva.{cc,hh}: Added. The bulk of the new line shape code
	is in here. These files fall under the MIT/X11 licence. More in the files.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Faddeeva should be in list in list.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added a phase lineshape variable.

	* src/methods.cc: Require another lineshape variable for m_zeeman.cc.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Split phase from attenuatiion polararization matrices.
	Requires another line shape without caring which type, though for physical
	reason this line shape should be Faraday-Voigt.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/zeeman/*: Changed necessary bits to work since
	a new line shape changes results. Change in reference is on order of 0.02 K.

2013-01-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-450

	* src/m_append.h, src/methods.cc (Append):

	from difference between scattered field and scattered extinction
	field.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_doit.cc (doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D):

	Add parameters scat_aa_grid, normalize and norm_error_threshold. Make
	doit_scat_field input and output.

	Call doit_scat_fieldNormalize if turned on.

	(doit_i_fieldUpdate1D, doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1DPP):

	Set doit_i_field also as input.

	* src/doit.{cc,h} (doit_scat_fieldNormalize):

	Add new function for calculate the scattered extinction field and
	apply correction factor to doit_scat_field.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts:

	Turn on new normalization in doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D.

	* controlfiles/general/agendasDOIT.arts:

	Add comment with example code to turn on new normalization in DOIT.

	* src/workspace.cc: Fix typo.

	* README: Add missing =1.

2013-01-16  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-447

	* src/cia.{h,cc}
	(CIARecord::Species): Added this function, which returns the
	contents of mspecies.
	(CIARecord::Extract): Started on implementation of this, but
	realized that guessing the right dataset is too difficult, we have
	to make this a user choice.
	(CIARecord::ReadFromCIA): Now converts the binary absorption
	cross-sections to ARTS SI units.

	* src/m_cia.cc
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddCIA): Implemented this.
	(abs_cia_dataReadFromCIA): To decide whether this is a CIA
	species, Use SpeciesTag.Type() function instead
	of SpeciesTag.Cia()

	* src/methods.cc (abs_cia_dataReadFromCIA): Added built-in
	documentation on units.

	* src/abs_species_tags.{h,cc}
	(SpeciesTag): Removed member mzeeman, instead added member mtype,
	which can be TYPE_PLAIN, TYPE_ZEEMAN, TYPE_PREDEF, TYPE_CIA. Added
	also public member function Type() for this and removed public
	member function Zeeman(). Adapted member functions to this change.
	(is_zeeman): Added this function for ArrayOfSpeciesTag, which can
	be used if a tag group is a Zeeman group. This has to be checked
	for the whole group, not just for the first tag, since the Zeeman
	tags could be in the middle. They could be mixed with continuum
	tags (but not with normal line-by-line tags.)

	* src/absorption.cc: Cosmetics.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines): Adapted to new
	is_zeeman function.
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts): Adapted to new SpeciesTag::Type() function.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc): Adapted to new
	is_zeeman function.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeeman): Adapted to new
	is_zeeman function.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia: Added. For CIA testing.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/TestCIA.arts: Added.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/cia/README.txt: Added.

2013-01-15  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-445

	* src/partition_function_data.cc: Replaced infunctional data: O and He
	were constant -1, which triggers a runtime error. CH3OH was constant 0,
	which would have caused an uncaught bug (division by 0) if ever used.
	For CH3OH and O TIPS provides constant 0, which is rubbish. Replaced
	those by JPL data instead. He set to constant 1.

	* src/absorption.h (CalculatePartitionFctRatio):
	Make sure qtemp==0 throws a runtime error, too, avoiding div0.

	* 3rdparty/partFct/partition_functions.py:
	Added functionality for deriving partition function coefficients from
	JPL for CH3OH and O.

2013-01-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-444

	* src/m_transmitter.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): As below.

	the planetary toolbox. Several controlfiles added, documentation still
	to be done.

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/validation/[common,passive]/:
	Added. Structure for validation cases (controlfiles & output(?)).

2013-01-10  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-437

	* src/absorption.cc (calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4):
	Set in effect catch for broad_spec_vmr_sum==0 with additional catch of
	vmr_self==0 simultaneously (that can happen now that we apply
	zero-padding in AtmFieldsCalc when p_grid exceeds range of all gas
	profiles of the atm scenario).
	!!! In the latter case, xsec will be 0 - needs to be confirmed whether
	this is consistent with the general use of LUT (in general,
	abscoefs=xsec*vmr are 0 for vmr=0, but xsec are defined to be
	independent of vmr. that is, with the current solution we could get
	problems when trying to use this LUT for non-zero vmr) !!!

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupInit):
	Proper initialization of (empty) abs_lookup.

	* src/workspace.cc (abs_lookup):
	Corrected reference to corresponding section in AUG.

2013-01-07  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-436

	* src/check_input.[cc,h] (chk_atm_vecfield_lat90): Nicer error message
	when problems at poles. Increased (temporarily?) deviation threshold to
	1 per mille. We might need a better lon-regridding routine here (as
	vector fields do not vary linearily, but sinusoidal), but current issues
	anyway seem to already be in the original data (AI JM: check that data!).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): minor layout fix.

2013-01-03  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

2012-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-423

	* All around Faraday rotation should now hopefully be in place.
	The result of the test case checked by integrating(Ne*B) in
	Matlab. So it looks OK.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/TestFaradayRotation.arts:
	Changed min pressure, and now using HSE to recreate altitudes for
	IRI and IGRF, by "incverting" what Jana did.
	Reference data updated.

	* controlfiles/testdata/tropical.expanded.t.xml: Changed
	ionopsheric temperature to 200, to be closer to what Jana used when
	calculating p for IRI and IGRF.

	* doc/uguide/cloudradar.tex: Changed status in history from
	Started to Written.

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: Removed the old Faraday section
	stub, and some small fixes. Status now set to "Written"

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex (chapter{Faraday rotation}): Added some
	references for additional support, and a comment about that a
	numerical value on the Wikipedia page on "Faraday effect" is slightly
	wrong.

2012-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-422

	* controlfiles/testdata: Added a number of 1D files to also cover
	the ionosphere. Ne and magnetic field extracted from IRI and IGRF.
	For T and Z just a simple extension of Fascod tropical. Should be
	replaced with better data.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/faraday/: New test case.

	* src/methods.cc: Added description of Farday aux vars, for
	iyTransmissionStandard.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex (section{Theory}): Some polishing.

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex (section{Description of the
	ionosphere}): Slightly extended.

2012-12-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-421

	* Not sure if all changes captured below. Anyhow, Faraday rotation
	now implemented in a general way (only lacking from DOIT and MC).
	Some documentation is lacking, and test case will be created.

	* doc/uguide/faraday.tex: A new chapter.

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex: Wrote a small section on ionospheric
	variables. Reintroduced a figure, as a new odd page was created.

	* src/m_rte.cc: Stuff moved to other files, see below.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Added use_mean_scat_data as
	input argument, for consistency with other methods. Adopted call
	of get_ppath_trans2.

	* src/jacobian.cc: Some (previously local) functions moved here
	from m_rte.

	* src/m_transmitter.cc: New file. Placed iyRadioLink,
	iyTransmissionStandard and iy_transmitterCloudRadar here.

	(iyTransmissionStandard): Adopted call of get_ppath_trans2, and
	added hamndling of Faraday rotation aux vars.

	(iyRadioLink): Adopted call of get_ppath_trans2.

	(iy_transmitterSinglePol): New WSM.

	(iy_transmitterMultiplePol): iy_transmitterCloudRadar renamed.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans2): Added handling of Faraday
	rotation, following get_ppath_trans.

2012-12-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-420

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Removed core Faraday code, and
	adopted call of get_ppath_trans throughout the file.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Adopted call of
	get_ppath_trans.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans): Faraday rotation now implemented as
	part of this function.

2012-12-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-419

	* src/m_rte.cc: For several functions, adopted call of
	get_ppath_atmvars.

	(iyRadioLink): Complete treatment of Faraday rotation (at least
	correct order of magnitude results). But thinges wil be rearranged
	to be more general, for incorporation in other WSMs as well.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Adopted to change below.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_atmvars): Added treatement of free electrons.

2012-12-14  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	MPM92O2AbsModel, MPM93O2AbsModel, PWR93O2AbsModel,
	MPM93_O2_continuum):

	If vmr for current pressure level is exactly zero, set pxsec also to
	zero instead of failing with a runtime error.

2012-12-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-417

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): More work on Faraday rotation.
	Overall code is in place, but Ne not yet included in the
	calculation.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_rte_pos): Check of rte_pos2 demanded 1D
	latitudes to be inside +-90. Higher values are needed when working
	with links to GPS datellites. Limit now set at 180 deg.

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_sat2sat): Had to change the way correct
	usage is checked, as with ionopshere a satellite can be inside the
	model atmosphere.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Tensor4AddScalar): Created, following the
	corresponding WSM for Tensor3.

2012-12-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-416

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Some more work on Faraday rotation.
	Mainly to figure out the correct combination of basic constants
	(e, m, c etc.) when using SI units. The factor 2.34e4 given in
	several places, is now calculated from fundamental constants.

2012-12-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-415

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Started on Faraday rotation.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs): Adopted to below. The [-1] option
	would never happen.

	* src/workspace.cc: Changed description if rte_mag, mainly
	removing the option of [-1].

2012-12-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-414

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink2.arts:
	Adopted, selecting defocusing method 2.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): The method considers now also
	particle extinction, including aux vars. Defocusing method can be
	selected by the user.

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex (subsection{Extra path delay}):
	Removed the idea about returning dn/c.

2012-12-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-413

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: Fixed types found at a quick
	reading, and removed obselete parts of the additional defocusing
	section.

2012-12-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-412

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: More writing (including stuff not
	yet implemented!).

2012-12-07  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-411

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldExpand1D): Bugfix - lon-dim calc of
	expanded cloudbox had a typo. Remove cloudbox_checked as input -
	that didn't deliver any additional security  (cloudbox_checkedCalc
	should anyway be done on the expanded fields again), but required some
	else unnecessary, messy settings before (e.g. cloudbox_checkedCalc
	requires basics_checked, which requires z_surface to be set, i.e.,
	requires to set 1D z_surface and update/change to 2/3D later on.)

	* src/methods.cc: Adapted pnd_fieldExpand1D according to above.
	Additional minor fixes (cross-links, ...) on doc in a number of methods.

2012-12-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-410

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: A first complete version of
	14.2.2-4 written.

2012-12-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-409

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: Some more writing ...

2012-12-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-408

	* Attacked some compiler warnings. (Don't know how to handle the
	one appearing in m_cloudbox.cc.)

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceFlatReflectivity): Removed input
	rte_los, as now not used.
	(surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity): As above.

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensor_checkedCalc): sensor_response_za was
	used where it should be sensor_response_aa. And antenna_dim was
	not considered properly when checking sensor_response_aa.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Setting defocusing attenuation to a
	dummy value (to avoid compilation warning).

2012-12-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-407

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex: Started to revise and extend this
	section.

2012-12-03  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-406

	* src/cia.{h,cc}: Added. Implementation files for HITRAN-based Collision
	Induced Absorption (CIA) continua. Only starting on this, please
	ignore compiler warnings.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added CIA targets.

	* src/test_cia.cc: Added. For testing of CIA functions.

2012-12-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-405

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink2.arts: Added
	more aux variables. Changed to distance bettween transmitter and
	reciever to get more defocusing.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts: Some
	cleaning.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Added Free space attenuation.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Background set to 9.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_set_background):
	(ppath_what_background): Added "transmiter" with 9 as code.

2012-11-26  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-404

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc): Made this work correctly
	with artscat4 (fixed bug reported by Jana). Now calls xsec_species
	directly for the line absorption calculation, instead of through
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/absorption/TestCompareArtscat3And4.arts:
	Added a test with lookup table.

2012-11-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-403

	* src/agenda_class.cc (Agenda::execute):

	Catch std::bad_alloc. This is not perfect, because it only gives us
	the workspace method where the allocation failed, not the exact
	function in the code. But better than before without any clues.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs):

	Add try catch around Tensor5.resize(). As this is large it is prone to
	fail. By catching the std::bad_alloc exception here, we can give as
	much information as possible about where the problem is to the user.

	This should be done in other places where potentially large data is
	allocated too.

	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_no_background): Tweak comments.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_3d): Removed some obsolete code
	related to tangent points.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_basic): Call
	do_gridcell_3d_byltest with lraytrace as start value for length
	search, to make sure that it safes to take a path step of this
	length. Before -1 was used, and the length lraytrace was not
	necessarily probed.

2012-11-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-401

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): resolve_lon was applied
	too late for final points, that could cause an assert when
	starting the next step. Code restructured to fix this.

2012-11-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-400

	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_no_background):

	Change averaging between the ppath steps to be consistent with the
	clearsky part. Previously, averaging between ppath points was done for
	temperature, pressure and vmrs. Now abs_mat_per_species is calculated
	on each ppath point and then averaged.

	Here are the differences between the old way and the new way:
	TestDOIT:
	  y_0-y_old OK (maximum difference = -0.0505823).
	  y_1-y_old OK (maximum difference = 0.00250382).
	TestDOITBatch:
	  ybatch[0]-ybatch_old[0] OK   (maximum difference = 0.00277304).
	  ybatch[1]-ybatch_old[1] OK   (maximum difference = 0.00306167).
	  ybatch[2]-ybatch_old[2] FAIL (maximum difference = -0.0143527).
	  ybatch[3]-ybatch_old[3] OK   (maximum difference = 0.00944391).
	  ybatch[4]-ybatch_old[4] OK   (maximum difference = -0.00804398).
	  ybatch[5]-ybatch_old[5] FAIL (maximum difference = 0.03268).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.ybatch.ref.xml:

	Updated reference values.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Compare):

	Don't fail immediately when comparing arrays. Instead, collect all
	errors and throw an exception at the end.

2012-11-24  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-399

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario): Don't add a dot between basename and
	species if basename ends in '/', i.e. is a directory.
	(abs_h2oSet): Don't throw an error, but set abs_h2o to [-1], if H2O is
	not in abs_species (we need abs_h2o only for selected continua. so we
	should at least be able to make lbl calculations without H2O).
	(abs_coefCalc,abs_coefCalcSaveMemory): First call
	abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts, then abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines. In case
	continuum calc throws an error due to missing abs_h2o, we want to avoid
	having done a heavy lbl calc before.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc): as for abs_coefCalc (see above).

	* src/absorption.cc (calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4):
	- Instead of throwing an error when broad_spec_vmr_sum <0.9, only send a
	warning to out2 (it's anyway rescaled to vmr=1, hence we don't make big
	errors)
	- catch case that broad_spec_vmr_sum==0 (applying gamma_self for full
	vmr=1). Not in effect yet as after fixing the abs_lookup-wit-artscat4
	bug might make it obsolete (though, a catch of possible div0 seems
	preferable anyways.)

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmRawRead): Don't add a dot between basename and
	name of atmfield if basename ends in '/', i.e. is a directory.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/catalogue/TestReadCataloguePerrin.arts:
	Use abs_speciesDefineAllInScenario (instead of manually setting
	abs_species) to catch ALL species with line files to test.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky.arts: Fixed typo.

2012-11-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-398

	* src/methods.cc: Added missing \n.

2012-11-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-397

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::parse_generic_output):

	Fix bug reported by Patrick. Wrong logic in if-statement lead to
	non-existent output variables being automatically created for WSMs
	with names shorter than 7 chars.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc):

	Turn off zeropadding for t_field in 3D case (was already off for 1D).

2012-11-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-396

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/catalogue/TestReadCataloguePerrin.arts:

	Add simple testcase to read the whole Perrin catalogue.

2012-11-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-395

	* src/absorption.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Fix for crash when reading catalog files where n and j are missing.

2012-11-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-394

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): Added test also with
	respect to upper pressure level, for r_v[j]. This after getting an
	assert also in this direction. The z_field was quite crazy, but
	still formerly correct.

2012-11-22  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-393

	* src/m_planets.cc,methods.cc (g0Jupiter, g0Mars, g0Venus):
	Added. Methods for getting z=0 gravity for other planets. They don't
	consider ellipsoid shape of the z=0 body (for now they only set a
	Numeric), but could be added.

	* src/agendas.cc (iy_cloudbox_agenda, surface_rtprop_agenda):
	A bit of polishing of the online documentation.

	* controlfiles/general/planet_[jupiter,mars,venus].arts:
	Added. Helper-includes corresponding to planet_earth.arts for other
	planets. Sets a couple of planet-specific constants/parameters.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts:
	Added iy_cloudbox_agenda predefinitions, and g0_agenda predefinitions
	for other planets. Renamed ppath_agenda__PassiveSensorPath to
	ppath_agenda__FollowSensorLosPath according to Patrick's suggestion.

	* controlfiles/general/agendasDOIT.arts: replace iy_cloudbox_agenda
	setting by copied predefined agenda.

	* controlfiles/[artscomponents,instruments]/*/*.arts: Replaced
	ppath_agenda__PassiveSensorPath -> ppath_agenda__FollowSensorLosPath.
	
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts:
	Adapted compare-to-reference message to actual reference value used.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Minor cleaning/re-sorting.

2012-11-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-392

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): Check of r_v[j] when
	surface inside grid cell was not complete.

2012-11-22  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-391

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Added different Landé constants, gs, for
	various molecules to make the frequency shifts closer to
	measurements (previously only free electron case was resolved,
	though gs tend toward 2 the 'less free' the electron is from
	the nuclear	angular momentum).

	* controlfiles/testdata/isoquantum.xml: Should be read together
	with all AddZeeman since it contains the values above. Changed
	test-file to make it compatible with this new scheme.

	* src/absorption.cc: Now reads HITRAN quantum numbers
	differently for various Zeeman species. NO should be possible to
	Zeeman split in ARTS as is, whereas OH and ClO still need some work.

	* src/methods.cc,src/workspace.cc,src/absorption.h: Small changes.

2012-11-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-390

	* doc/uguide/references.bib: Add thayer74_improved_rs.

2012-11-21  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-389

	* Continued setting up predefined agendas. Removed all AgendaSet and
	INCLUDE	from general.arts - the user is forced now to explicitly set all
	agendas needed. Adapted Test*.arts accordingly.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: Revised completely. Containing
	agenda predefinitions, no agenda settings(!).

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_surface.arts: Added. INCLUDE to
	agendas.arts containing predefinitions for surface_rtprop_agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_new.arts:
	Removed. Now all of this in agenda.arts.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Removed any INCLUDEs. Removed
	setting of refr_index_agenda.

	* controlfiles/general/planet_earth.arts: Some refurbishing.

	* controlfiles/[artscomponents,instruments]/*/Test*.arts:
	Adapted to general.arts changes - explicit setting of agendas that
	previously were set by agenda.arts is now WITHIN the arts controlfiles.

	* src/m_surface.cc,methods.cc(surfaceLambertianSimple),workspace.cc:
	Made number of streams in lambertain calculation (formerly: np, now:
	lambertian_nza) a WSV.

2012-11-21  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-388

	* doc/uguide/refr_index.tex,rte.tex,ppath.tex:
	Expanded documentation on refraction and (gas) refractive index.

2012-11-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-387

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): termination_flag was
	before set even if the other stop criterion (evol_op<=r) had been
	reached during the path step. This gave an undersampling of points
	just above the surface. A test case had before an bias of about
	0.7 K. This bias is now removed (tested to a precision of
	1 sigma= 0.05 K).
	After this no obvious bias in any of my test calculations :-)

2012-11-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-386

	* New version mcPathTraceGeneral now activated. That is, MCGeneral
	now considers ppath_step_agenda, and gives warnings if tau of any
	path step is higher than 4.

	In addition, other MC methods moved to mc_NotUSed.cc. These
	methods could be activated on demand (then to be revised and tested).

	* src/workspace.cc: mc_z_field_is_1D removed.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (cum_l_stepCalc,):
	* src/montecarlo.cc (iwp_cloud_opt_pathCalc):
	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceIPA):
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (mc_IWP_cloud_opt_pathCalc):
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCIPA):
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (pha_matExtractManually): All moved to
	mc_NotUsed.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneral): "Test version" has now
	replaced old version.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/
	  TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	ppath_lmax set to 3km (needed to avoid warnings about tau > 4).
	Setting of mc_z_field_is_1D removed.

	New reference values:

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/
	TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts:
	I: 198.8 -> 198.6
	Q: 8.0 -> 7.6

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	I: 199.1 -> 198.3
	Q: 7.6 -> 7.8

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts: I:
	I: 199.5 -> 199.4

2012-11-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-385

	* Version number here in ChangeLog was not updated.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/
	TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts: A stupid last minute typo!

2012-11-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-384

	* For documentation purposes, before changing MC, the reference
	values for the MC tests were checked. For two of the tests, the
	reference I values were found to be too high, with about 2.5K
	(precision of test calculations about 0.35K). This change in
	reference value could have been caused in arts-2-1-347, when the
	cloudbox was enlarged to cover all non-zero pnd_field. The sign of
	the change in I is consistent with more particles along the path.

	But third test had already OK value. Changed without comment here?
	No time to investigate this further.

	The changes:

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/
	TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts:
	I: 201.0 -> 198.8
	Q: 7.6 -> 8.0

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	I: 201.8 -> 199.1
	Q: 7.6 (no change)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts: I:
	199.5 K (Not changed, as the significant difference to new
	calculations. And this quite close to the new values above.)

2012-11-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-383

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneralTEST): A warning is now
	given if the optical thickness of the path step exceeeds 4.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): New rejects the "path trace" if
	g=0, with a warning to out0. That is, this trace does not
	contribute to I_sum.

2012-11-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-382

	* src/m_doit2.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming2): Completed? (code, not
	documentation)
	(iyInterpCloudboxField2): Work in progress.

2012-11-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-381

	* controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/odin_bchannel.m:
	* controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/odin_antenna.m: Two functions
	to set up Odin-SMR simulations. In contrast to old setup_input.m,
	these functions are stand-alone (ie. Qsmr not needed).

2012-11-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-380

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneralTEST): Code cleaned up. Now
	completely adapted to ppath calculated with lmax. Seems to work,
	but more tests needed.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): A bit of cleaning of error
	messages, as well as code indentation.

2012-11-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-379

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Revised 3D part. Resurrected text
	and figure for lengt-search algorithm.

	* src/ppath.cc: Functions now not used moved to ppath_NotUsed.cc.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex (section{Calculation accuracy}): Moved one
	paragraph to ppath.tex.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Updated. Two new sub-sections, describing
	spacing between additional points and discussing tangent points.

2012-11-16  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-378

	* started setting up predefined agendas, the user can chose than from by
	just copying them to the respective required agenda. WORK IN PRROGRESS.
	commit mainly in order to have synced code on my notebook.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas_new.arts: Added. Current place for
	predefined agendas. For now, used as an include to agendas.arts.

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts: include agendas_new.arts.

2012-11-16  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-377

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex, ppath.tex: Removed/adapted references to
	explicit tangent point inclusion in ppath.

2012-11-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-376

	* Tangent points are now never included in a special manner. This
	has gradually disappeared, and now also removed from geom. 1D and
	2D. This to be more consistent, makes the code cleaner, and
	(marginally) faster.
	Note that with a non-spherical ellipsiod there are two possible
	tangent altitudes, min radius and min vertical distance to geoid.
	It is the later that is most interesting, but it was the first one
	that was included.
	Anyhow, if you run with lmax <= 10 km the difference is really
	small between present and old results. At least for passive
	observations (e.g. no reference values not changed for passive).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts:
	Deactivated "compare" as results have changed somehwat:
	0.00011 deg (out of 0.6921) for bending angle and
	0.3 ns (out of 637 ns) for extra path delay.
	Will re-activate when the radio link part is revised.

	* src/ppath.cc (geompath_r_at_l): Removed assert for negative l,
	as l anyhow squared.

	(geompath_from_r1_to_r2): Now handles that r1 and r2 can be on
	different side of a (r-based) tangent point. An extra input
	argument added for this.

	(do_gridrange_1d): Adopted to change in geompath_from_r1_to_r2,
	and hence always return complete step through grid cell.

	(ppath_step_geom_1d): Removed special handling of tangent points.

	(raytrace_1d_linear_basic): Adopted to changes above.

	(ppath_step_geom_2d): Removed special handling of tangent points.

	(do_gridcell_2d): Adopted to change in geompath_from_r1_to_r2.

	(raytrace_2d_linear_basic): Adopted to changes above.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): Removed old version and
	renamed the test version (ie. now the active function).

2012-11-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-375

	* ChangeLog: Remove leftover conflict marker from r7969.

2012-11-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-374

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Compare):

	Output the names of the variables being compared.

	Keep the sign around for final difference output.

	Make input parameter names consistent over all Compare functions.

	* src/methods.cc: Enable passing of WSV names for Compare WSM.

2012-11-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-373

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest2): Completed. Now the
	active version.

2012-11-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-372

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest2): Start on alternative
	version of the function.

2012-11-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-371

	* Input angle to interpolation in surfaceFlatReflectivity and
	similar methods was zenith angle. This shall now be incidence angle.
	That is, the angle to the surface normal, not zenith. This to
	decouple specification of surface RT properties from topography.
	The incidence angle should be <= 90 even with topography.
	(Not an issue for 1D, testing ongoing for 3D.)

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc): Removed a leftover cout-s.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs_fast.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_fast.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: Adopted to
	changes below.

	* src/surface.cc (surface_specular_los): Removed. Replaced by
	specular_losCalc.

	* src/m_surface.cc (complex_nFromGriddedField4): Removed rte_los
	as input. Not used.

	(surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity):
	(surfaceFlatReflectivity):
	(surfaceFlatRefractiveIndex): Now using specular_los and
	calc_incang.

	(specular_losCalc): Created.

	* src/surface.cc (calc_incang): Created.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added surface_normal and specular_los. 

2012-11-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-370

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceGeneralTEST): Some more work on
	this new version of the function. Still inactive

	* controlfiles/general/agendasDOIT.arts: Removed Ignore for
	rte_pos and rte_los in iy_cloudbox_agenda, as not needed.

2012-11-13  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-369

	* src/m_sensor.cc,methods.cc,workspace.cc,m_rte.cc:
	Introduced WSM sensor_checkedCalc and WSV sensor_checked in analogy to
	[basics,cloudbox]_checked and moved all sensor-related checks previously
	done at the beginning of yCalc to this WSM. Like
	[basics,cloudbox]_checkedCalc, sensor_checkedCalc now needs to be called
	before executing yCalc.

	* src/m_doit.cc(CloudboxGetIncoming):
	Now requires sensor_checked as input.

	* controlfiles/*/*/Test*.arts:
	Adapted controlfiles to the above changes.

2012-11-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-368

	* A bug fix for m_surface! (Bug created in 2-1-363)

	* A bug fixed for opt_propExtract (very old one).

	* (Work on introducing ppath_step_agenda into MCGeneral. Nothing
	new active, beside bug fix in opt_propExtract. )

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): tr_rev should not be updated
	for ip=np-1. Fixed.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_reflectivityFromGriddedField6): Mixed
	up old and new grid when doing "lon-shift".
	(surface_scalar_reflectivityFromGriddedField4): As above.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (opt_propExtract): PARTICLE_TYPE_HORIZ_AL did
	not work for za=90! Copied solution already added in
	ext_matTransform.

	BIG NOTE: Very similar code is found in opt_propExtract and
	ext_matTransform. If you find any problem in any of these
	functions, check also carefully if the same problem is found the
	other one!!!

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_copy): Some typos in comments

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): Added ppath_step_agenda and
	edensity_field as input and passed on to mcPathTraceGeneral.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC): Added ppath_step_agenda and edensity_field
	as input and passed on to MCGeneral.

2012-11-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

2012-11-13  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-366

	* src/m_doit.cc(DoitCloudboxFieldPut): Bugfix. Sensor-in-cloudbox check
	needs to run over measurements block = the rows of sensor_pos matrix.

2012-11-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-365

	* Forgot to make add on the new file.

2012-11-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-364

	* src/m_doit2.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming2): Started work on allowing
	sensor and surface inside cloudbox. So far making parallel methods
	and variables, named by adding a 2 at the end. And keep it in a
	separate, temporary, file.

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): For 3D, the if-statement
	for "end points of scat_za_index" was wrong for lat and lon parts.
	It had been fixed for pressure! Copied this to the lat and lon
	parts.
	A bug but (if I get it right) only one za-aa combination got wrong
	value (and just for 3D).

2012-11-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-363

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_reflectivityFromGriddedField6)
	(surface_scalar_reflectivityFromGriddedField4)
	(complex_nFromGriddedField4): Checks of before interpolation were
	not complete. Also added shifting of longitudes to handle mapping
	from e.g. [-180,180] to [0 360].

	* doc/uguide/scattering.tex:
	* doc/uguide/rte.tex:
	* doc/uguide/cloudradar.tex: Fixed the \wsmindex errors reported
	when running make check-all

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Added check that the
	upper vertical limit is above the surface.

	(create_gfields): Not all grid names were correct. Created data
	(used as test input) updated.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_scalar_reflectivityFromGriddedField4):
	Added checks of name of grids.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_griddedfield_gridname): Slight
	modification of error message.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_reflectivityFromGriddedField6): Added
	checks of name of grids.

	* src/methods.cc: Fixed some typos for
	surface_reflectivityFromGriddedField6. Stating expected name of
	grids for complex_nFromGriddedField4 and
	surface_*FromGriddedField4/6.

2012-11-09  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-361

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Added another scheme for calculating relative
	strength of the split components. Made it compatible with the
	rational class in order to make half-quantum number operations
	easier to implement in the future.
	
	(RelativeStrengthSMMBerdyugina) Easy to use scheme that now is
	the standard scheme for determining relative strength. See
	the reference in the text for more information.
	
	(Lande_RusselSaunders) Another way to get g. I am currently 
	trying to find a way for g of Hund a) transitions that works 
	in (FrequencyChangeDirect) and this g might be helpful.
	
	* src/rational.h/.cc: Made a rational class. There are still 
	some operators missing in this class so it cannot be considered
	complete. It works with src/m_zeeman.cc as far as I can tell.

2012-11-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-360

	* doc/uguide/cloudradar.tex: A basic documentation of the
	addition, quickly written, needs revision.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: Added defintion of "transmission
	matrix".

2012-11-08  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-359

	* src/cloudbox.h, m_atmosphere.cc, m_cloudbox.cc, cloudbox.cc,
	workspace.cc: replaced 'prof_type' -> 'partfield_name' and
	'profile type' -> 'particle field name'

2012-11-08  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-358

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc(particle_massesSet):
	Added. Method to derive particle_masses from scat_data_meta, in order
	to be able to consistently use particle_masses with ARTS internal
	pnd_field calculation methods.

	* src/methods.cc: Added particle_massesSet, some layout and formulation
	fixes to other methods.

	* src/workspace.cc: some cross-link fixes.

2012-11-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-357

	* doc/uguide/cloudradar.tex: So far just an empty chapter.

	* doc/uguide/transmission.tex (section{Pure transmission
	calculations}): Jsut fixed one bad sentence.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex (section{Auxiliary data}): Updated with
	respect to iy_auxFillParticleVariables.

	* src/methods.cc: Finished updates of built-in doc for
	cloud radar methods and other recent changes.

2012-11-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-356

	* arts-2-1-355

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D):

	Remove unnecessary loop over za in limb conversion test.

	Change type of doit_i_field_limb from Tensor6 to Matrix.

2012-11-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-354

	* src/m_doit.cc:

	(doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1D): Adaptively perform additional iterations
	for the limb case (90 < za < theta_lim) to improve overall convergence.

	Clean up redundant if statements.

	(doit_conv_flagAbsBT): Output diff_bt with sign.

	* src/optproperties.{cc,h}, src/doit.cc, src/montecarlo.cc:

	opt_prop_sum_abs_mat_per_species

	* src/cloudbox.cc (chk_scattering_data): Add _U_ to suppress warning.

2012-11-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-353

	* src/matpackVI.h: Add missing CHECK(v) to Tensor6View::operator().

2012-11-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-352

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Updated names and error
	messages, to be consistent with changes below.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iy_auxFillParticleVariables): New. Intended to be
	a help function to iyEmissionStandard, to fill "PND, type X" and
	"Mass content, X".

	(iyEmissionStandard): Now accepts "PND, type X" and "Mass content,
	X", but just sets the iy_aux element to be empty.

	(iyTransmissionStandard): "PND,  type X" and "Mass
	content, X" added as aux variables.

2012-11-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-351

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yCloudRadar): range_bins can now also be
	given in time. 

2012-11-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-350

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Now considering that the
	vector transmission is direction dependent. That is, there is now
	a transmission matrix for the propagation from the transmitter to
	the scattering point, and another matrix for the reversed
	propagation. (Needed as T1*T2 != T2*T1, where T1 and T2 are
	transmission matrices).
	Added round-trip time as aux var.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (yCloudRadar): Better handling of aux vars.

2012-11-05  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-349

	* src/cloudbox.cc: Several documentation fixes (particularly units
	of LWC&IWC).

2012-11-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-348

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iyCloudRadar): Added Bacscattering and
	particle field as aux variables.

2012-11-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-347

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc: Further work.

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Removed references to ppath_array,
	changed to \funcindex for ppath_calc.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Changed reference to ppath_cal to ppath_agenda.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: \builtindoc was used for ppath_calc.
	Changed to \funcindex.

	* doc/uguide/winds.tex: doppler_shift -> rte_doppler.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:
	cloudbox_checkedCalc called with explicit arguments, as for these
	MC-WSMs scat_data_mono replaced scat_data_raw.

	* particle_masses is now a mandatory "cloudbox variable", to
	complement pnd_field and scat_data_raw. However, can be left
	empty if particle mass is not used.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestMonteCarloDataPrepare.arts:
	pnd_field was non-zero at lat and lon limits of the cloudbox
	(catched by extension of cloudbox_checkedCalc). Changed lat and
	lon extension of cloudbox from +-1.8 to +-1.9 deg (following the
	grid of used raw pnd_field).

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Added particle_masses, set to
	be empty.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Added check for negative
	values in edensity_field.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (chk_pnd_field_raw_only_in_cloudbox): Moved from
	check_input.cc, to be placed beside some very similar functions.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxOff): Now also returning an empty
	particle_masses.

	(cloudbox_checkedCalc): Now also performing checks on pnd_field
	and particle_masses. Note that pnd_field is allowed to be >0 for
	lower altitude limit of the cloudbox, if this point is at or
	below the suface altitude.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (iwp_cloud_opt_pathCalc): particle_masses
	passed on to this function. Also adopted.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (mc_IWP_cloud_opt_pathCalc): Only WSM that
	used particle_masses. Adopted. Demands that particle_masses has a
	single column.

	* src/workspace.cc: Redefined the WSV particle_masses. The scope
	is now larger and the type is changed from Vector to Matrix.

2012-11-04  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-346

	* src/methods.cc: Fix.

2012-11-04  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-345

	* src/m_refraction.cc
	(refr_indexMWgeneral): Fixed. Newell&Baird method considers refractivity,
	not refractive index (exactly as, e.g. Thayer) - fix this in TN1 (or at
	least the upcoming reports). Gives now pretty similar results to Thayer.
	(refr_indexThayer): Replaced requiring of H2O by assuming H2O-vmr=0 in
	case of no H2O in abs_species, i.e., reducing it to dry air contribution
	in these cases.

	* src/methods.cc: Added description for refr_indexMWgeneral.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/[doit/TestDOIT,wfuns/TestWfuns,
	montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian,
	montecarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral].arts:
	Spell fixes.

2012-11-02  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-344

	* src/m_refraction.cc(refr_indexMWgeneral):
	Added. General, planetary applicable method for refr. index calculation
	following Newell&Baird, 1965. Reference refr. indices valid for
	microwave (also from Newell&Baird, 1965) currently hardcoded therein.

	* src/methods.cc(refr_indexMWgeneral): Added. Proper Doc TBD.

	* src/absorption.cc(xsec_species): Typo fixed.

2012-11-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-343

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc (iy_transmitterCloudRadar): Created.

	(yCloudRadar): Now also handling y_aux.

2012-11-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-342

	* src/m_sensor.cc: Some code moved to function below. And now
	instead that function is called.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added sensor_pol_array and range_bins.

	* src/CMakeLists.txt: Added m_cloudradar.cc.

	* src/m_cloudradar.cc: Started this file, and moved the new
	functions from m_rte.cc. Still work in progress.

2012-10-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-341

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCloudRadar): Changed order of data inside iy.
	Work in progress. Do not use!

	(iyBackCoeff2Ze): Just started. Got stuck due to bug fix below.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts: I did not get a
	good fit with the target/reference values, neither before or after
	bug fix below. The values seems to be old.
	Updated the target values, and decreased tolerance from 1.0 to 0.2 K.

	* src/m_physics.cc (complex_nWaterLiebe93): A bug! sqrt was not
	applied and the method returned the dielectric constant (eps)
	instead of refractive index (n), with n = sqrt(eps).

2012-10-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-340

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCloudRadar): Started. So far just experimental.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Adopted call of
	get_ppath_ext.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_ext): Added ppath_pnd as output argument.

2012-10-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-339

	* README: Was still containing a URL to the SAT server from Bremen
	times.

2012-10-25  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-338

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc
	(ParticleSpeciesSet,ScatteringParticlesSelect,pnd_fieldSetup):
	Introduced part_species delimiter as generic (defaulted) input
	parameter (in future maybe make it a preset WSV, cause currently there's
	quite a	bit of room for messing up by using different delimiter strings
	in the different WSM calls), pass delimiter on into parse_XXX and
	pnd_fieldXXX functions.
	Added check of part_species validity in ParticleSpeciesSet.

	* src/methods.cc
	(ParticleSpeciesSet,ScatteringParticlesSelect,pnd_fieldSetup):
	Introduced part_species delimiter as generic input parameter.

	* src/cloudbox.cc,cloudbox.h
	(chk_part_species):
	Introduced. Check function for part_species strings.
	(chk_scattering_meta_data):
	Removed obsolete particle type check (this is free from now (except for
	containing the part_species delimiter string)!).
	(pnd_FieldXXX,parse_XXX):
	Added part_species delimiter as input parameter.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc(AtmFieldsFromCompact):
	Adapted to parse_XXX now requiring delimiter as input.

	* controlfiles/testdata/chevallierl91_all_extract.xml: Moved to global
	testdata location from controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	doit/TestDOIT.arts: Increased number of azimuth angles from 10 to 37 (no
	significant impact for these cases, but as they also act as demo...).
	Atmfield location adapted according to above change.

2012-10-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-337

	* doc/uguide/check_refs.py: Agenda check was broken.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex, doc/uguide/ppath.tex,
	doc/uguide/scattering.tex, doc/uguide/surface.tex: Naming fixes.

2012-10-24  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-336

	* src/m_optproperties.cc (scat_data_rawCheck):
	Revised. Now throws an error, when deviation of C_sca from Z11 and from
	K-a gets to large (user defined threshold). Explicit warning that method
	only works for p20. More informative output on out2.

	* src/methods.cc,workspace.cc:
	Updated and improved(?) online-doc for ScatteringParticlesSelect,
	scat_data_rawCheck; part_species, scat_data_nelem.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doit/TestDOIT.arts,
	doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts, montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts:
	Apply scat_data_rawCheck.

2012-10-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-335

	* src/methods.cc:

	Add doit_i_field as output to doit_conv_flag* WSMs. Change name of
	throw_nonconv_error flag to nonconv_return_nan.

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_conv_flag*):

	Return NaNs in non-convergence case instead of throwing a runtime
	error.

2012-10-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-334

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_conv_flag*):

	Fix compilation with clang. (os << out -> os << out.str() )

2012-10-24  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-333

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_conv_flagAbs, doit_conv_flagAbsBT,
	doit_conv_flagLsq): Bugfixed iteration counter incrementation.
	
2012-10-24  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-332

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_conv_flagAbs, doit_conv_flagAbsBT,
	doit_conv_flagLsq):
	Fix hard-coded number of max. iterations in DOIT - made it a user-
	controllable parameter (with the previously hard-coded value of 100 as
	the default value). Also make it a user choice, whether to throw an
	error in case of non-convergence (this seems to be the logical
	consequence) or to accept the latest (but non-converged) scattering
	field as result (keeping this option and making it the default in order
	to avoid opening a can of worms NOW: a number of earlier calcs might
	suffer from that and failing at a single freq grid point would cause the
	whole calc to fail. we need a better fix for that!)

	* src/methods.cc: adapted accordingly

	* controlfiles/instruments/avhrr/avhrr_sensor_common.arts,
	avhrr_sensor_fast.arts, avhrr_sensor_reference.arts:
	Properly set names for a couple of datafiles to read - failed when used
	those arts files as includes outside the arts controlfiles folder.

2012-10-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-331

	* doc/uguide/check_refs.py: Update doc.

	* doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt: Make check-uguide depend on pdfs directly
	instead of custom arts_docs target for compatibility with older cmake.

2012-10-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-330

	* doc/uguide/check_refs.py: Add check for wsa_index macro.

	* doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt: Make check-uguide depend on arts_docs.

	* doc/uguide/absorption.tex, doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex,
	doc/uguide/rte.tex, doc/uguide/batch.tex:
	
	Fix some low hanging fruit.

	* arts-2-1-329

	* doc/uguide/check_refs.py, doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add script to check if non-existent WSMs or WSVs are referred in latex
	macros wsmindex, wsvindex and builtindoc.

	Can be run with 'make check-uguide'.

	* src/absorption.h (BroadSpecName):
	
	Add empty string return value in addition to the assert to avoid
	warning in release mode compilation.

2012-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-328

	* The minimum number of photons applied in MC can now be
	controlled. It was before hard-coded to 100.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: mc_min_iter set to 100
	(that is,  consisient with older hardcoded value).

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral,MCIPA): Now using mc_min_iter
	(demanding that the value is >= 100).

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC): Added mc_min_iter.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added mc_min_iter.

2012-10-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-327

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_basic, ppath_step_geom_3d):
	Going back (hopefully temporarily) to old 3D ray tracing scheme.
	Still safer than new one!

2012-10-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-326

	* src/ppath.cc: A warning! Found a case where new 3D ray tracing
	code failed and not yet fixed.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathWriteXMLPartial): Using Oliver's new code,
	it was easy to test that it is only the grid positions that make
	the Matlab importing so slow for ppath. For this reason,
	reintroduced nreal and ngroup.
	(In my present test, importing the partial ppath takes about just
	1% of the time for imprting the complete one!)

2012-10-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-325

	* src/m_ppath.cc, src/methods.cc:

	Add ppathWriteXMLPartial. Writes only essential ppath data fields for
	better performance when needed.

2012-10-16  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-324

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Added another scheme for calculating relative
	strength of the split components. Also added another scheme to get
	the extinction matrices that take into account dispersion. 
	
	(RelativeStrengthLindauAndLifshitz) seem to agree
	perfectly with the tables used previously at applicable lines.
	It should also work for the more general cases and regardless of
	particle, though this has yet to be tested. For more information
	on this, see Lindau and Lifshitz QED (volume 4).
	
	(KMatrixRees) seems reasonable, though it needs to be tested more
	before I say anyone should trust it.
	
	Changed names of some functions and added some new (#Define) for
	ease of using the various schemes. The current setup does not fail
	the TestZeeman.arts controlfile. Need to make some better way to
	switch between the different Zeeman splitting schemes in the future.

2012-10-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-323

	* src/absorption.{h,cc} (LineRecord::ARTSCAT4FromARTSCAT3):

	Don't fail for lines already in ARTSCAT4 format, just skip those.

	Move implementation to cc file.

2012-10-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-322

	* src/m_batch.cc (ybatchCalc):

	Correct error message. Since ybatch is now an ArrayOfVector, y for
	failed batch cases is simply empty, not -1.

	Add informational output to out1 that we're aborting if a batch case
	fails and robust==0. Gives feedback to the user that something went
	wrong and that we will bail out of the batch loop when all the
	currently running cases have finished (which may take a bit of time).

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (Compare): Add newline in error message.

2012-10-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-321

	* src/src/methods.cc: ybatchCalc now also returns ybatch_aux.

	* src/m_batch.cc (ybatchCalc):

	Add ybatch_aux as output.

	Move definition of y and jacobian inside the batch loop.

	* src/agendas.cc: Add y_aux as output to ybatch_calc_agenda.

	* src/groups.cc: Add group ArrayOfArrayOfVector.

	* src/workspace.cc: Add new WSV ybatch_aux.

	* src/xml_io_types.h, src/xml_io_instantiation.h,
	src/xml_io_array_types.cc, src/nc_io_array_types.cc:

	Add ArrayOfArrayOfVector support.

	WSMs {Matrix,Numeric,Vector,Tensor7}Compare merged into one
	supergeneric Compare function.

	* src/src/m_batch.cc (ybatchCalc):

	Change type of ybatch to ArrayOfVector. Remove code for separate
	calculation of first batch job. Batch calculations are now run in
	parallel immediately, not only after the first job is done.

	Change type of ybatch to ArrayOfVector.

	* src/methods.cc:

	Merge all TYPECompare WSMs into one supergeneric Compare function.

	* The core DOIT part is hard-coded to return radiance (frequency
	based, blackbody_radiation_agenda is not used). This puts a demand
	on that CloudboxGetIncoming returns radiances. You could imagine
	to use CloudboxGetIncoming for other things than DOIT, where other
	units could be of interest. But as recent changes made it more
	difficult to use DOIT for batch calculations, I have added some
	checks in CloudboxGetIncoming to help the users. So,
	CloudboxGetIncoming can now only return radiance data.

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Now also checks iy_unit and
	blackbody_radiation, to ensure that frequency based radiance data
	are obtained.

	(CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm): As above. In addition, now also
	considering basics_checked and cloudbox_checked (as done in the
	method above).

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Now uses the function below
	(that is based on code from this method).

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_if_std_blackbody_agenda): New function.
	The function tests if blackbody_radiation_agenda returns
	frequency based radiance, as assumed in some places.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: Fixed (FrequencyChangeDirect).
	My hope is this function better describe the general problem and
	will thus work for more species. Also, the Lenoir tables used did
	not describe cases with DN != 0 when DJ == 0. Will have to construct
	quantum transition rules first, then this should allow more general
	Zeeman effect calculations. The quantum electron spin number is
	currently defined constant but it should be a species property.

	* src/constants.cc: Added Bohr magneton and lande_gs.

	* Completed most of the OpenMP cleanup. The program is never exited
	directly from inside parallel loops anymore. All exceptions are passed
	up until they're caught in the main function. This should always give
	a clear error stack.

	* If you still encounter errors that look like the messy example below,
	please file a bug report with me!!!!! You should always see the
	'Stopping ARTS' and 'Goodbye' line. If not, that's a bug too. Note
	that is does not apply to assertions.

	Before, error messages could look like this example when runtime errors
	occured in parallelised parts of the code:

	Executing Arts
	{
	....
	- ybatchCalc
	Method abs_mat_per_speciesAddOnTheFly needs input variable:
	abs_lines_per_speciesMethod abs_mat_per_speciesAddOnTheFly needs input
	variable: abs_lines_per_speciesMethod abs_mat_per_speciesAddOnTheFly
	needs input variable: abs_lines_per_species
	Method abs_mat_per_speciesAddOnTheFly needs input variable:

	variable: abs_lines_per_species
	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::ios_base::failure'
	  what():  basic_ios::clear
	Abort trap: 6

	Now they (should) look like they this:

	* OpenMP cleanup, work in progress.

	* src/m_batch.cc (ybatchCalc), src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs):

	Never exit from inside the parallel loop. Instead set an abort flag
	that skips remaining iterations, collect runtime error messages (from
	all threads if necessary) and rethrow them after the loop.

	Work in progress. This should be done for all parallel loops.
	I'll continue with that in the next commits.

	* src/agenda_class.cc (Agenda::execute):

	Tweak log output to play nicer with multiple threads.

	Don't call arts_exit inside here because we might be run inside
	multiple threads. Throw a runtime_error instead. Calling the C library
	exit function from multiple thread gives random errors (assertions,
	terminate called twice message, or even core dumps) at program exit.

	To be done in the next commits: Make sure we only have a single exit
	point out of the program. All exceptions should be passed upwards
	until they're dealed with in the main function.

	* src/continua.cc (PWR98H2OAbsModel): Parallelize pressure loop.

	(PWR93O2AbsModel): Parallelize pressure loop. Handle exception inside
	loop and rethrow it after the loop.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCalc):

	Remove omp nested. Handled properly by the loop condition.

	(abs_mat_fieldCalc): Tweak pressure loop parallel condition.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc, src/m_batch.cc, src/messages.h, src/rng.cc, 
	src/m_abs_lookup.cc, src/rte.cc:

	Replace all unnamed critical regions with named regions. All unnamed
	critical directives map to the same unspecified name. That means only
	one thread at a time will be allowed to enter one of those regions
	throughout the whole program at any time.

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species): Tweak parallel condition.

	* src/m_general.cc (Print): Move output of newline to the right place.

	(SWITCH_OUTPUT): Use ostringstream for nicer multithreaded output.

	(Print): Remove overload for ArrayOfIndex to use the output operator
	directly.

	* src/main.cc: Don't turn on omp nested. Usually not necessary and
	might have bad side effects (thread explosion). Should only be turned
	on in places that really need it.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc, src/m_doit.cc, src/m_rte.cc:

	Remove commented out omp code.

	* arts-2-1-309

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyApplyUnit, yApplyUnit): n set to 1 in call of
	apply_iy_unit functions.

	(iyEmissionStandard): apply_iy_unit functions called with n.

	* src/rte.cc (apply_iy_unit): Added refractive index as input, and
	n2-law included in used expressions.

	(apply_iy_unit2): As above.

2012-09-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-308

	* Main change is that unit conversion is moved from iyb_calc down
	to methods for iy_main_agenda. This solves several issues:
	- Not all unit conversions make sense everywhere. For example,
	radiance conversions should not be applied on active signals.
	The selection of units can now be implemented on method level.
	- Now more clear when iy_unit makes sense (if not, not an input 
	argument!").
	- Back-conversion in iyMC now not needed.
	- The n2-law can be implemented without a lot of overhead (but not
	yet done).

	* controlfiles/*: About 20 controlfiles adopted renaming of
	iy_unit and ApplyUnit methods.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts: A
	special case among the cfiles. For DOIT the unit must now be "1"
	when calling CloudboxGetIncoming. Final unit can first be set
	afterwards. So definition of iy_unit had to be moved into the
	batch agenda.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Adopted removed parts from
	iyb_calc, thus iy_unit is new input. Built-in doc corrected and
	extended.

	(iyApplyUnit): iyApplyYunit renamed. jacobian_do removed as input.
	Documentation adopted and extended.

	(iyCalc): Removed diy_dx as output. Jacobians are only partly
	supported on iy-level (perturbations made at yCalc level),
	and safest to remove diy_dx here.

	(iyMC): Removed back-conversion to radiance. Updated doc.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc: Removed y_unit from all methods (where it was
	passed on to iyb_calc).

	* src/rte.cc (apply_iy_unit): Renamed from apply_y_unit.
	(apply_iy_unit2): Renamed from apply_y_unit2.

	(iyb_calc): Removed everything associated with unit conversion.

	* src/workspace.cc: y_unit renamed to iy_unit, to reflect where
	the conversion now will be applied. Most of documentation moved to
	iyEmissionSteandard (as not generarly valid).

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: end_lstep was called start_lstep in
	structure table.

	* This commit fixes the behaviour of the TYPECreate methods. After
	creating a new variable, instead of being initialized with 0 or empty,
	its state is now uninitialized. This is the same as for the builtin
	workspace variables.

	* src/agenda_class.h (MRecord):

	Add minternal flag. Is set to false if the method is from the
	controlfile and true if it was added by the engine. For example, Create
	and Delete calls for automatically generated variables (for literals)
	are flagged as internal.

	* src/agenda_class.cc (Agenda::execute):

	Use the new isInternal flag to determine output level instead of some
	funky string comparisons on the method and variables names.

	* src/methods.cc (define_md_data_raw):

	Update docs for the Create methods.

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::parse_agenda):

	Insert a Delete after TYPECreate methods to make the new variable
	appear uninitialized.

	(ArtsParser::tasklist_insert_set_delete):

	Set the internal flag for MRecord to true for the automatically
	inserted Set and Delete methods.

	* Add support for reading and writing of isotopologue_ratios to an XML
	file. The file format is similar to the ARTSCAT format.

	Default values for isotopologue ratios can be extracted from the
	built-in species_data (this is done by default in general.arts) and
	then be written to a file:

	isotopologue_ratiosInitFromBuiltin
	WriteXML("ascii", isotopologue_ratios, "isos.xml")

	Instead of intializing isotopologue_ratios from species_data, they can
	then simply be read:

	ReadXML(isotopologue_ratios, "isos.xml")

	Note that all ratios are initialized with NAN. If species are missing
	from the input file, those values will stay NAN.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:

	New class SpeciesAuxData. Used to hold runtime values for
	IsotopologueRatios at the moment, but can be used for other parameters
	in the future. Reading routine is also in here.

	(write_lines_to_stream): Remove declaration of non-existent function.

	* src/species_data.cc:

	Replace all -1. ratio and mass values for continua with NAN.

	* src/groups.cc: New group SpeciesAuxData.

	* src/workspace.cc, src/gas_abs_lookup.h, src/m_abs.cc,
	src/m_abs_lookup.cc, src/m_zeeman.cc:

	Change type of isotopologue_ratios from ArrayOfVector to
	SpeciesAuxData.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc, src/xml_io_instantiation.h,
	src/xml_io_types.h:

	Add reading/writing for SpeciesAuxData.

	* src/nc_io_compound_types.cc, src/nc_io_instantiation.h,
	src/nc_io_types.h:

	Add dummy for SpeciesAuxData type.

	* arts-2-1-279

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts,
	controlfiles/artscomponents/wfuns/TestWfuns.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/hirs/TestHIRS.arts,
	controlfiles/instruments/odinsmr/TestOdinSMR_1D.arts:

	Add more Ignore(ppath_los) to non-Zeeman absorption agenda definitions
	in remaining check-all tests.

2012-09-07  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-278

	* General: Fixed a major miss in treatment of Zeeman regarding
	what los vector to use. Used to take sensor los instead of
	point path los.
	
	* Controlfiles/*: Added Ignore( ppath_los ) to non-Zeeman absorption
	agenda definitions.

	* src/rte.cc: Sends ppath.los at ip into abs_mat_per_species_agenda 
	in relevant functions.
	
	* src/doit.cc, src/montecarlo.cc, src/disort.cc, src/m_abs_lookup.cc:
	Sends in dummy ppath_los to absorption agenda. Did not check if these
	had ppath defined and could us the real los instead since they already
	send in dummy magnetic field.
	
	* src/methods.cc: abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeemanLBL now takes ppath_los
	instead of rte_los. Also takes atmosphere_dim for use of mirror_los.
	
	* src/workspace.cc: Added ppath_los.
	
	* src/agendas.cc: Updated abs_mat_per_species_agenda to take ppath_los.
	
	* src/m_zeeman.cc: In effect mirror_los(*) of ppath_los replaces rte_los.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: switch on TestHIRS again (TestAVHRR also
	running, but computational expensive and need not that different from
	TestHIRS).

	* src/absorption.cc(calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4):
	VMR-"Warning" throws an error, hence -> "Error".

2012-09-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Added flowchart. Some language fixes. Made
	the "Compulsory sensor ..." section a bit shorter, by removing
	less important discission. This hopyfully completes the revision
	of the chapter.

	* doc/uguide/sensor.tex: Extended with two paragrapghs from rte.cc.

2012-09-07  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-270

2012-09-07  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-267

	* starting cleaning & reorganizing of general.arts:

	* controlfiles/general/agendas.arts,planet_earth.arts: Added. INCLUDE
	files supposed to hold agenda predefinitions & default settings and
	planet specific default settings. For the moment just everything falling
	into those categories moved from general.arts to those. Need further
	development/structuring/cleaning.

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Clean up. Keeping only "real"
	defaults, i.e., settings that are basic and usually not reset.

	* controlfiles/[artscomponents,instruments]/*/Test*.arts: Adapted all
	test cases to above general.arts changes (particularly moved setting of
	atm_dim, stokes_dim, cloudboxOff, jacobianOff into the Test ctrl-files.
	user shall be forced to explicitly set those parameters).

	* controlfiles/instrument/amsu/TestAMSUA.arts: Removed. Except for the
	amsua.arts include, which does not exist, and the MatrixCompare of the
	output this is identical to TestAMSUB.arts. So no need to keep it.

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: switch on ALL existing test cases (except
	TestDisort, which needs to be fixed. or removed.)

	* controlfiles/instruments/hirs/garand_profiles.xml.gz: Moved to
	controlfiles/atmosphere_data/.

	* arts-2-1-265

	* src/m_sensor.cc (sensorOff): Removed atmosphere_dim as input.
	Was just passed to sensor_responseInit, that needs for some checks
	of no relevance in this case. So dim now set internally to 1.

	This unlogical dependency of atmosphere_dim was pointed out by
	Jana. Thanks.

	* arts-2-1-260

	* General: First implementation of explicit broadening calculation
	for all broadening species from Agnes catalogue. Not yet tested!

	* src/absorption.cc (LineRecord): Changed the way the foreign
	broadening and shift parameters are stored. Leads to changes in
	output operator and catalogue reading routines.
	(operator<<): Updated.
	(ReadFromArtscat4Stream): Updated.
	(find_broad_spec_locations): Updated.
	(calc_gamma_and_deltaf_artscat4): Added. This is the internal
	function that does the actual broadening calculation.

	(BroadSpecName): Added.
	(NBroadSpec): Added.

	on auxiliary data.

2012-09-04  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-256

	* src/absorption.cc
	(find_broad_spec_locations): Added. It finds
	the positions of the broadening species (N2, O2, etc.) in
	abs_species.
	(xsec_species): Modified call parameters. Added:
	all_vmrs (instead of vmr), abs_species, this_species. Removed:
	abs_h2o_orig. We now have all species descriptions and VMRs
	available, so that we can calculate the broadening by the
	different gases explicitly. (The broadening calculation itself is
	not yet implemented.)

	* src/m_abs.cc
	(abs_coefCalc): Adapted to change in xsec_species.
	(abs_coefCalcSaveMemory): Ditto.
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines): Ditto.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCreate): Ditto.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc (abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeemanLBL): Adapted to
	changes in xsec_species. Commented out call to calculation
	of continua, since I believe it should not be here. This makes
	also several input arguments unnecessary, removed them.

	* src/methods.cc
	(abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeemanLBL): Updated.
	(abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines): Updated.

	* src/absorption.h: Added enum for position indices of broadening
	species in abs_species (SPEC_POS_N2, SPEC_POS_O2, SPEC_POS_H2O,
	SPEC_POS_CO2, SPEC_POS_H2, SPEC_POS_He).

	* src/lineshapes.cc
	(Rosenkranz_Voigt_Kuntz6): Removed.
	(Rosenkranz_Voigt_Drayson): Ditto.

2012-09-04  Richard Larsson <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-255

	* src/m_abs.cc: Minute change.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: For now the temporary abs_species only
	carry the "O2" tag. All other tag information is lost.

2012-09-03  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-254

	* controlfiles/planetary_toolbox/: Added folder for collection of
	controlfiles for ESA planetary toolbox.

	documentation.

2012-09-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-253

	* arts-2-1-252

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: To be continued ...

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Code for RT step with
	polarised absorption changed. Usage of mult avoided for emission
	part, to make use of the fact that the b-vector contains zeros.

	* doc/uguide/wfuns.tex: Added fixme to explain diy_dx.

2012-09-03  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-251

	* src/species_data.cc: Added new HITRAN species&isotopologues and other
	species required for ESA planetary study. Updated/revised documentation.
	Corrected isotopologue abundancies from JPL (such that have IR(main
	isoptope) given as 1).

	* src/partition_function_data.cc: Added partition function coefficients
	for new species/isotopologues. Updated documentation (FIXME: re-add code
	to derive polynomial coefficients from TIPS and JPL partition function
	data! It's a hassle trying to reproduce existing and consistently derive
	new coefficients, when this is gone!). Re-enacted use of ceoff tags for
	documenting data source.

	* src/absorption.[cc,h]: added output operator for SpeciesRecord
	(currently only outputs the species name tag. extend as needed.)

	* src/agendas.cc(iy_surface_agenda), src/workspace.cc(transmitter_pos):
	spellfixes in doc.

2012-09-03  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

2012-09-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-249

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Extended, but not yet finished.

	* doc/uguide/*.tex: Some general cleaning. Removed some
	double-defined labels. Updated to new names of some WSV and WSM
	(blackbody_radiation_agenda, iyTransmissionStandard ...). Some
	agendas ended up in Index under WSV.

	* doc/uguide/reduction.tex:
	* doc/uguide/wfuns_sensor.tex:
	* doc/uguide/measerr.tex:
	* doc/uguide/wfuns_atm.tex: All removed, obselete (the content can
	be picked up from AUG-1).

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: Removed the command SAbVec (not
	used, and probably just confusing).

	Changed the symbol for identity matrix to 1. This to avoid
	confusion where the identity matrix and the stokes vector appear
	in the same equation (I used for Stokes).

2012-08-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-248

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: More updating: To reflect e.g.: upward
	observations outside the atmosphere is now accepted,

	Change terminology as proposed by Stefan. Isotope -> Isotopologue

2012-08-31  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-245

	* GENERAL: Removed WSV abs_scalar_gas and the last remaining WSMs
	that had to do with it.

	* src/workspace.cc (abs_scalar_gas): Removed.

	* src/methods.cc (abs_scalar_gasCalcLBL): Removed.
	(abs_mat_per_speciesAddFromAbsCoefPerSpecies): Added. This method
	is similar to the old method abs_scalar_gasFromAbsCoef that has
	been removed. Used internally by abs_mat_per_speciesAddLBL.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines): Do not calculate
	for Zeeman species. (They are ignored in the same way as species
	with empty line list are ignored.)
	(abs_mat_per_speciesAddFromAbsCoefPerSpecies): Added.
	(abs_scalar_gasFromAbsCoef): Removed. (Replaced by the above method.)
	(abs_scalar_gasCalcLBL): Removed. (Content is now part of
	abs_mat_per_speciesAddLBL.)
	(abs_mat_per_speciesAddLBL): Removed special handling (ignoring)
	of Zeeman species (now done in abs_xsec_per_speciesAddLines).

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (calc_lookup_error): Use
	abs_mat_per_speciesAddLBL instead of abs_scalar_gasCalcLBL.

	* src/m_optproperties.cc: Fixed errors in comments.

	* src/disort.h (dtauc_ssalbCalc): Fixed wrong absorption agenda name.

	* src/disort.cc: Fixed errors in comments.

	* src/montecarlo.h (mcPathTraceGeneral): Fixed wrong absorption
	agenda name.

2012-08-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-244

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex: Updated. Added a short section on
	geo-location by lat_true and lon_true. Nothing about polarised
	absorption now mentioned in cloudbox section. Commented out second
	3D figure (no additional information and chapter then fits into 6
	pages).

	* doc/uguide/in_and_out.tex: New chapter. So far just treating
	data formats.

	* doc/uguide/concept.tex: Changed name of chapter to
	"Introduction". A few language fixes. Some short updates, such
	that radio links can be treated. Moved section on data formats to
	new chapter.

	Added three FIXME:
	\FIXME{Control file structure changed, update this section!}
	\FIXME{Revise this section after general.arts has been changed.}
	\FIXME{The tests are now structured differently. Update the text.}

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: Changed
	abs_mat_per_speciesExtractFromLookup to
	abs_mat_per_speciesAddFromLookup (in a comment).

2012-08-31  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-243

	* src/absorption.h (isContinuum):

	Use isdigit instead of isnumber to fix build on Linux.

2012-08-31  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-242

	* src/absorption.h (IsotopeRecord):

	Add isContinuum(). Instead of demanding the abundance being -1 for
	continua, this test relies on the name of the continua tags not
	starting with a number like normal isotopes.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_xsec_per_speciesAddConts),
	src/continua.cc (check_continuum_model),
	src/absorption.h (abs_linesReadFromSplitArtscat),
	src/m_abs_lookup.cc (find_nonlinear_continua):

	Use isContinuum to detect continua.

2012-08-30  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-241

	* Naming and documentation of Zeeman and absorption:
	Changed some method names to be more consistent with
	intentions and removed abs_scalar_gas from documentation.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyLoopFrequencies): Finished and tested. Seems
	that we now have a general mechanism to handle dispersion and
	similar issues.

	* arts-2-1-239

	* GENERAL: All test controlfiles work again. Warning: One method
	renamed (see below).

	* src/methods.cc (abs_mat_per_speciesAddFromLookup): Renamed from
	abs_mat_per_speciesExtractFromLookup. Updated documentation. Now
	takes f_grid as input instead of f_index.

2012-08-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-238

	* src/doit.cc (iy_interp_cloudbox_field): Added a check that
	should catch if DOIT would be used together with
	iyLoopFrequencies (which would fail).

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyLoopFrequencies): Created (not tested, below called
	iyRunMonochromatic).

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming, CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm):

	abs_mat_per_species_agendaExecute call.

	Remove f_index from opt_prop_add_abs_mat_per_species.

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_scalar_gasCalcLBL, abs_mat_per_speciesCalcLBL):

	* arts-2-1-236

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRunMonochromatic): Just started.

	* src/doit.cc (cloud_RT_surface): Added a comment.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): Introduced f_mono (to avoid
	forming this vector repeatedly).

	* src/rte.cc (get_iy_of_background): Removed outdated comments. 

2012-08-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-235

2012-08-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-234

	* transmitter_pos now input to yCalc and converted to rte_pos2,
	following sensor_pos/rte_pos. This allowed that mblock_index now
	is completely invisible for the user. In addition, rte_pos2 is now
	defined throughout the rt part and more complex set-ups are
	possible (such as considering surface reflections of transmitted
	signals).

	* controlfiles: Many cfiles had to be adopted.

	* src/m_doit.cc: Adopted to changes below. rte_pos2 consistently
	set to an empty vector (no transmitter can be involved for DOIT).

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc):
	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCalc, iyEmissionStandard, iyRadioLink)
	(iyTransmissionStandard): Basically replaced mblock_index with
	rte_pos2.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianCalcAbsSpeciesPerturbations)
	(jacobianCalcPointingZaRecalc)
	(jacobianCalcTemperaturePerturbations): Added transmitter_pos as
	input argument and passed on to iyb_calc.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Now using transmitter_pos.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc): Now using transmitter_pos (and checks that
	size is empty or match sensor_pos).

	* src/agendas.cc: Replaced mblock_index with rte_pos2 for
	iy_main_agenda and ppath_agenda. And added rte_pos2 for
	iy_surface_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: Updated/extended text for transmitter_pos and
	rte_pos2.

2012-08-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCIPA):
	* src/doit.cc (cloud_ppath_update1D, cloud_ppath_update1D_noseq)
	(cloud_ppath_update3D): Adopted call of ppath_step_agenda.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_blackrad, get_ppath_abs)
	(get_ppath_trans, get_ppath_trans2): Now not using f_index.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard, iyRadioLink)
	(iyTransmissionStandard): f_index totally removed.

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_general_sub, defocusing_general)
	(defocusing_sat2sat): f_index changed to f_grid.

	* src/m_ppath.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc:
	* src/refraction.cc: f_index changed to f_grid everywhere used.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexFreeElectrons): Now not using
	f_index. On-line doc updated accordingly.

	* src/agendas.cc: Replaced f_index with f_grid as input to
	ppath_agenda, ppath_step_agenda and refr_index_agenda.

2012-08-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-231

	* TODO: Some points fixed and removed.

2012-08-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-230

	* New version of transmission WSM appears ready. The approach has
	been changed. Treatment of cloudbox built-in. This should be more
	efficient calculation-wise, and also makes the iy_aux feature more
	useful (as data for the complete path through the atmosphere are
	returned).

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): The method handles now
	also paths going through the cloudbox. Added particle extinction
	as aux var.

	(iyTransmissionStandardCloudbox): Code has been inactive. Now
	completely removed.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (is_gp_inside_cloudbox): atmosphere_dim is now
	an input argument. Default is 3, as previously assumed by the
	function.

	(is_inside_cloudbox): Also this function assumes 3D (without any
	warning). Added comment in header and assert to warn about this.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudboxOff): The method now also "touches"
	pnd_field, use_mean_scat_data and scat_data_raw (to handle all
	cloud variables that can be input to a iy_main_agenda-method).

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_trans2): New.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_pnd, get_ppath_cloudrtvars): Both
	functions replaced by other methods. Removed.

2012-08-23  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-229

	* src/absorption.h (LineRecord): Added info on ARTSCAT-4 format.

2012-08-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-228

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_partext): Started (not finished, not yet
	used).

	* src/special_interp.cc (interp_cloudfield_gp2itw): Changed
	function to operate on GridPos, instead of ArrayOfGridPos.

	* src/physics_funcs.cc (barometric_heightformula): Moved the
	function from cloudbox.cc. This function has hard-coded parameters
	that also are defined in constants.cc. Should be fixed!

2012-08-21  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-227

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc): remove zeropadding for
	temperature profile (zeropadding still done for VMR and only VMR).

	* src/methods.cc  (AtmFieldsCalc):
	Documented zeropadding/extrapolation behaviour.

	* src/absorption.h (CalculatePartitionFctRatio):
	Improved error message (runtime error when partition function negative).

2012-08-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-226

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Added check that all
	temperatures > 0. A zero temperature not catced elsewhere. For
	example, I got a segementation fault for MC!

2012-08-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-225

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink2.arts: A

	manual tests.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts:
	Adopted and header slightly expanded.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Dispersion functionality removed.
	Added handling of pressure, temperature, VMR and absorption aux data.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Corrected error messagge around iy_aux.

	* src/workspace.cc: Removed dispersion_do (the idea is to later add
	dispersion in a general way (if possible?)).

2012-08-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-224

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink_Old.arts:
	To temporary get a copy of old version of file below.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts: Partly
	rewritten to use yCalc and check some aux vars.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Fixed two bugs associated with
	dispersion.

2012-08-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-223

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species):

	Initial hack to support calculation with an artscat version 4.
	Air broading is currently calculated by weighting N2 and O2 by
	0.79/0.21. The weighting is applied to width, temperature exponent
	and pressure shift. Most likely not the correct way to do it, but
	results are surprisingly close to calculations based on Hitran
	(ClearSky test case within 0.004 K).

2012-08-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-222

	* src/absorption.cc (LineRecord::ReadFromArtscat4Stream):

	Read quantum numbers from artscat4 files.

	Set Tgam to same value as in Hitran for now.

2012-08-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-221

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_rtvars): Obselete and removed.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Now using new get_ppath_XX
	functions. Some features reactivated. No proper tests performed.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/transmission/TestTransmission.arts:
	Demonstration of iy_aux added.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyTransmissionStandard): Code now synced with last
	changes in iyEmissionStandard. Set of aux vars extended.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts: Check
	of radiance reactivated, now using error extracted from y_aux.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC): Error now exported as part of iy_aux. This
	done by setting iy_aux_vars to: [ "Error (uncorrelated)" ]

	(yCalc): Uncorrelated error in y_aux detected automatically and
	sensor response applied correspondingly.

2012-08-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-220

	* Some unfinished work around aux vars and y_unit.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Extended.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyMC): iy_aux introduced. Only one option: Error.
	(iyApplyYunit): Extended.

	* src/methods.cc: Added text for MCGeneral around y_unit and
	mc_error. For yCalc some explanation around y_unit and y_aux.

2012-08-17  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-219

	* src/absorption.{h,cc} and src/m_zeeman.cc: Quantum numbers are
	now stored as Index(s) in LineRecord.

2012-08-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-218

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky.arts: Added

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/pencilbeam/TestPencilBeam.arts:
	Added some new variables to iy_aux_vars.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Added special code for vector
	unpolarised case (only for radiance, no change for jac.).

	* src/rte.cc (trans_step_std): Removed (was not used).

	* src/lin_alg.cc (matrix_exp): Extended header text (to make clear
	that diagonal case is handled efficiently).

	(rte_step_std): In header text, removed suggestion to use for
	"clearsky" (following test by Richard).

2012-08-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-217

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_abs):

2012-08-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-216

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Extensive changes, following
	modifications in rte.cc. Jacobians should now be fully OK again
	(but only for unpol. absorption, there is a runtime error if
	absorption is polarised).

	* src/rte.cc: Cleaning and restructuring of get_ppath_XXX and
	iy_transmission_XXX:

	(iy_transmission_mult): Now only function of this type. 

	(iy_transmission_for_scalar_tau, iy_transmission_mult_scalar_tau):
	Removed.

	(get_ppath_abs, get_ppath_trans, get_ppath_blackrad): New
	functions, that will replace get_ppath_rtvars.

	* src/logic.cc: A few cosmetic changes.

2012-08-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-215

	* Tweaking parallelization. TestClearSky ~1.8x faster.

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_rtvars): Parallelize over pressure levels.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc): Only parallelize if nmblock >= numthreads.

2012-08-16  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-214

	* src/workspace.cc, src/agendas.cc and src/methods.cc: Updated
	documentation regarding the abs_mat_per_species implementation.

2012-08-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-213

	* src/lineshapes.cc:

	Remove redundant parameter nf from lineshape and normalization
	functions.

	Add const to input parameters of lineshape and normalization functions.

	Make local variables const where possible. Might help the compiler to
	do better optimizations.

	(lineshape_norm_no_norm): Remove unnecessary loop.

	* src/absorption.h:

	Make input parameters of lsf_type and lsnf_type const.

	Remove redundant argument nf from lsf_type and lsnf_type.

	* src/absorption.cc (xsec_species): Remove redundant parameter nfls.

2012-08-15  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-212

	* src/lin_alg.cc (matrix_exp): Optimized for diagonal matrices.

2012-08-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-211

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda):
	* src/rte.cc:
	* src/m_rte.cc: In short, changed iy_aux to be a ArrayOfTensor4
	(to allow storage of complete extinction matrices).

	(iyEmissionStandard): Changed iy_aux_vars Radiance and
	Transmission to iy and Optical depth, respectively.

	* src/array.h: Defined ArrayOfArrayOfTensor4.

2012-08-14  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-210

	* Changes to remove abs_scalar_gas_agenda, and
	opt_prop_add_gas_agenda. Replaced these by internal function
	and abs_mat_per_species_agenda. This in turn means changes in
	several test cases.

	* src/doit.cc, src/montecarlo.cc, src/disort.cc:
	Unresolved issue: How to handle magnetic fields in these
	methods? Current solution: rte_mag = [-1], i.e. [Ignore flag].

	* src/m_rte.cc: Changes how the extinction matrix is handled
	in the radiative transfer equation.
	Unresolved issues: (1) Jacobians are in this version treated 
	as per the scalar case. (2) Some aux-variables are ignored
	due to changes in how iy is calculated --- and because I do
	not fully understand how to handle iy_aux.

	* src/rte.cc: get_ppath_atmvars now demands and returns 
	magnetic field variables. In get_ppath_rtvars ppath_abs,
	ppath_tau, total_tau replaces their scalar counterparts.
	Dimensions are also changed so that ppath_abs have dimensions:
	[ppath_vmr.nrows(), f_grid.nelem(), stokes_dim, stokes_dim,
	ppath.np]. In get_ppath_cloudrtvars the magnetic field is
	treated as for wind and rte_mag = [Ignore flag].
	iy_transmission_for_scalar_tau →
	iy_transmission_for_tensor3_tau.
	iy_transmission_mult_scalar_tau →
	iy_transmission_mult_tensor3_tau.
	Warning: naming convention is confusing with both
	iy_transmission_mult and iy_transmission_mult_tensor3_tau
	taking arguments (Tensor3, ConstTensor3View, ConstTensor3View).

	* src/workspace.cc: added "abs_mat_field" for lookup and
	"abs_mat_per_species" because it is important for all 
	other changes made.

	* src/methods.cc: Added "abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeeman". 
	Changed relevant things from scalar absorption to matrix
	absorption.

	* src/agendas.cc: Removed opt_prop_add_gas_agenda. Changed
	abs_scalar_gas_agenda to abs_mat_per_species_agenda.

	* src/optproperties.cc: Added opt_prop_add_abs_mat_per_species
	to replace pot_prop_add_gas_agenda.

	* src/m_abs.cc: abs_mat_per_speciesInit method to initiate
	abs_mat_per_species to the correct size with values of 0.
	abs_mat_per_speciesCalcLBL now gets the extinction matrix
	for all non-Zeeman species. Warning: using this and only
	this method for absorption when Zeeman species are present
	will result in ignorance of all Zeeman species.

	* src/m_zeeman.cc: abs_mat_per_speciesAddZeeman works just
	like abs_mat_per_speciesCalcLBL though only for Zeeman species.
	If rte_mag = [Ignore flag], the Zeeman species will be treated
	as per the scalar case.

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc: Changed abs_lookupCreate to completely
	ignore Zeeman species for now. Added
	abs_mat_per_speciesExtractFromLookup to extract scalar
	absorption and fit it with abs_mat_per_species for now.
	Changed abs_fieldCalc to use the new agenda. This file
	completely ignores the Zeeman effect for now with
	rte_mag = [Ignore flag].

	* Small changes in: src/gas_abs_lookup.cc, src/m_doit.cc, 
	src/m_montecarlo.cc and m_optproperties.cc.

	* doc/uguide/polarization.tex: Changed e_v in theory chapter
	to reflect Mishchenko.

	* arts-2-1-209

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts: Call

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyEmissionStandard): Removed Clearsky from name,
	following change of iy_clearsky_agenda.

	* src/agendas.cc: Renamed iy_clearsky_agenda to iy_main_agenda. 
	This as not all WSM for this agenda are striclty clearsky, and to
	indicate that this is "the entry point" for RT calculations.

2012-08-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-207

	* Basic changes for extraction of additional data ready, and 
	iyEmissionStandardClearsky modified accordingly. Aux feature

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/pencilbeam/TestPencilBeam.arts:
	Updated. Includes new aux variables and shows that ppath is
	directly avaliable for saving.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc: Adopted several methods to change of iyb_calc.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/montecarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts:
	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda):
	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Adopted to change of iy_clearsky_agenda.

	* src/m_rte.cc: Adopted several methods to change of
	iy_clearsky_agenda.
	
	(iyEmissionStandardClearsky): Added VMR, absorption and radiative
	background as auxilary variables.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yFromIy): Removed. Realised that this method
	implies strong restrictions for y_aux, which makes the method of
	little interest. The users need to learn the distinction between y
	and iy variables ;-)

	(iyEmissionStandardClearsky): Modified version of the method. 
	Handling some first aux variables.

	(yCalc): Now handles new version of y_aux.

	(yApplyYunit): y_unitApply renamed.

2012-08-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-204

	* Changes in many files around iy_aux. Largely

	* src/methods.cc:

	Change lat_true/lon_true to lat_grid/lon_grid for WSM
	FieldFromGriddedField.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc:

	(FieldFromGriddedField): Take cases into account where
	lon_grid.nelem()==0 || (lon_grid.nelem()==0 && lat_grid.nelem()==0).
	The gridded field should then have exactly size 1 in those dimensions.

	(FieldFromGriddedFieldCheckLatLonHelper): Added.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_size):

	Use singular in error message for VectorView.

2012-07-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	Allow file extensions [.xml,.xml.gz,.gz]. Search also in include paths.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc:
	- Renamed p_gridFromAtmRaw -> p_gridFromZRaw (as z_field_raw is the
	actual data p_grid is expected to be taken from). Bugfixed (extract
	correct extend) and made robust (also allow z_field_raw with decreasing
	z values). open issue: why are levels with z<0 removed, is that
	necessary for any module of ARTS?

	* src/methods.cc: Updated/corrected according to above.

	* src/workspace.cc: spell fixes reciever->receiver.

	* doc/uguide/gridded_field_gridnames.txt: some additions.

	variable.

2012-07-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-187

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceLambertianSimple): Can now only be used
	for 1D. Anyhow quite strange for 2D and 3D. And not obvious how to
	consider surface topography for 3D.

	(This finishes this revision of the surface part.)

2012-07-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-186

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceFlatRefractiveIndex)
	(surfaceFlatReflectivity, surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity): Added
	some input variables, needed to call extended version of
	surface_specular_los.

	* src/surface.cc (surface_specular_los): Now consider surface
	topography in calculation of specular direction.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda): Removed everything
	connected to calculation of surface normal.

2012-07-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-185

	* src/math_funcs.{cc,h}, src/matpackI.{cc,h} (cross3):

	Promote cross3 to matpackI as it is quite general. Adapt argument
	types to fit with the other functions.

2012-07-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-184

	* src/methods_aux.cc, src/methods.h (MdRecord):

	msuppress_header -> muses_templates
	SupressHeader() -> UsesTemplates()

	(MdRecord::MdRecord):

	Throw runtime_error if supergeneric methods use type "Any" but
	muses_templates is set to false.

	* src/make_auto_md_h.cc (write_method_header):

	mdd.SuppressHeader() -> mdd.UsesTemplates()

	* src/methods.cc: SUPPRESSHEADER > USES_TEMPLATES

	(define_md_data_raw): Remove unnecessary arguments from methods that
	use the defaults anyway such as SETMETHOD(false), AGENDAMETHOD(false),
	USES_TEMPLATES(false)

2012-07-17  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* arts-2-1-183

	* src/matpackIII.{h,cc} (mult): Elementwise vector multiplied
	with Matrix to create Tensor 3. Useful, e.g., for frequency
	gridded absorption vector multiplied by normalized Stokes
	extinction matrix to get extinction matrix as a function 
	of frequency.

2012-07-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-182

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda): Some further work on
	including surface tilt in calculation of specular direction. The
	code has still no practical impact.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (cross3): Renamed the function also in header
	text.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Now using LACC for comparison
	between l and ltan. This solved a case that failed. The problem
	was linked to the fact that the tangent point was exactly on top
	of a lat/lon crossing. This change fixed it.	

2012-07-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-181

	* absorption.cc:

	Add quantas to output operator of LineRecord.

	Make the output operator of LineshapeSpec a bit more useful.

	* src/math_funcs.{cc,h}:

	Rename cross to cross3 because it's limited to Vectors with 3 elements.

2012-07-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-176

	* src/check_input.{cc,h}:

	Add chk_interpolation_pgrids* functions for pressure grids. When
	p2gridpos_poly is used for log conversion, the prior checks have to be
	done in log scale, too.

	chk_interpolation_grids_loose_no_data_check and
	chk_interpolation_grids_loose_check_data.

	* arts-2-1-168

	* CMakeLists.txt, README:

	Add option WITH_XCODE_LIBCPP to enable C++11 and libc++ in Xcode.

	Use dwarf-with-dsym debug format in Xcode to get the static libraries
	properly symbolized for debugging.

2012-07-03  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-167

	* doc/doxygen/CMakeLists.txt:

	Rebuild of the documentation was not triggered after source changes.
	Add dependencies to all source files. Remove target apidoc_forced.

	Remove latex related code because we don't build it anyway.

	* doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in: Update config file to doxygen 1.7.
	
	Add MARKDOWN_SUPPORT=NO. On doxygen 1.8, the tags on
	the mainpage are not substituted properly. Currently commented out
	because it generates a warning on earlier doxygen versions.

2012-07-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-166

	* ChangeLog: Cleanup.

	Remove arts-2-1-162 attributed to me (but not done by me) which was a
	duplicate entry of arts-2-1-164.

	Restore version number arts-2-1-162 of Patrick's last commit which was
	falsely changed to arts-2-1-163.

	Restore the commit date for arts-2-1-161 to 2012-06-24.

	Add a dummy entry for the now non-existent arts-2-1-163 to get the
	version numbering back in line.

2012-07-01  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-165

	* src/check_input.h (chk_atm_field):
	Corrected default value of chk_lat90 flag (of course, as default we DO
	want to check consistency at poles!).

2012-06-30  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-164

	* src/check_input.[cc,h]
	(chk_atm_field): Added flag to switch off no-variation-with-longitude-
	at-poles check (cause this requirement does not apply for fields that
	are part of a vector fields with N&E components).
	(chk_atm_vecfield_lat90): Added. Does no-variation-with-longitude-
	at-poles check for total vector length of fields with N&E components.
	Allows some deviation (1e-2%) to avoid numerics causing a failed check.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Adapted atm_field checks
	for wind and magnetic field fields to above changes.

2012-07-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-163

	* Bump.

2012-06-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-162

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky.arts: A
	complete test designed. The "compare" calls not activated as
	radiances will change when surface tilt will be considered in
	surface part.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_2d,do_gridcell_3d): For surface
	crossing part, changed to lt<l to lt<=l. The surface should be
	selected instead of lower pressure surface, if they are on top of
	each other. (Good to make new test cfiles, discovered after
	modifying TestClearSky.arts).

2012-06-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-161

	* src/agenda_class.cc (Agenda::check):

	Delay check for custom-defined agendas.

	(Agenda::execute): Adapt runtime error message if the user tries
	to execute an agenda that was created by AgendaCreate.

	* methods.cc (define_md_data_raw):

	Set PASSWSVNAMES to true for Copy.

	* src/m_copy.cc (Copy):

	When copying an agenda set the name of the output agenda to its
	variable name.

	* ChangeLog: Reconstruct missing entry for arts-2-1-160 from svn log.

2012-06-28  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-160

	* src/m_surface.cc (complex_nFromGriddedField4):
	More checks (GF grid names, requested lat/lon covered), use grid
	position indices, shift field.lon by +/-360deg if requested lon is off.

	* src/geodetic.[cc,h] (lon_shiftgrid):
	Added function for shifting longitude grid to cover the 'space' of a
	given longitude (providing a fix to the issue that lon and lon+360 refer
	to same meridian, but both can occur as valid values in ARTS)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/complex_n_field.xml:
	Adapted to changed requirements on grid names.

2012-06-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-159

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/clearsky/TestClearSky.arts: Started
	to reformulate this test. Before it did a bit of everything,
	including some jacobians and absorption lookup table. The aim now
	is to make a basic general test of yCalc for for 1D, 2D and 3D.
	Work in progress.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/pencilbeam/TestPencilBeam.arts:
	Extended the header text somewhat, to better express the aim of
	the cfile.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: Adopted to
	cnew input of iySurfaceRtpropAgenda.

	* src/m_surface.cc (iySurfaceRtpropAgenda): Started to implement
	calculation of surface normal. Had re-introduce some input arguments.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_slope_2d): Calculation of upward argument
	for gridpos2gridrange was incorrect. Always generated true!
	However, this could in fact have been an OK definition. So nothing
	was terribly wrong.

2012-06-27  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-158

	* src/m_surface.cc (complex_nFromGriddedField4): misspelling corrected.

2012-06-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-156

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): A bug originating from when I
	added f_grid as input to iy_space_agenda. Did happen only if
	f_grid.nelem() > 1. Catched by an assert, so no risk that you have
	done incorrect calculations.

2012-06-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-155

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc:

	GriddedFieldLatLonPRegrid -> GriddedFieldPRegrid

2012-06-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-153

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_atmosphere.cc:

	Add skeleton FieldFromGriddedField, GriddedFieldLatLonExpand,

2012-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-152

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake, src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Remove the _CACHE from version check. Otherwise fix from arts-2-1-135
	requires a second cmake run to work.

	Add arts_test_cmdline macro for commandline option tests.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Some Xcode fixes: Set CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT to empty so we don't have
	to manually reset the current SDK every time the project is
	regenerated.

	Set LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH and EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH to have all
	executables end up in the same build directory.

2012-06-26  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-151

	* controlfiles/general/general.arts: initialize mag_[u,v,w]_field.

2012-06-26  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-150

	* src/workspace.cc:
	Introduced magnetic field components (mag_[u,v,w]_field).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc, src/methods.cc (basics_checkedCalc):
	Added mag_[u,v,w]_field to checks.

2012-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-149

	* doc/uguide/gridded_field_gridnames.txt:

	Add file with grid naming conventions.

2012-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-148

	* ChangeLog: Too many typos in previous log message to let it slide.

2012-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-147

	* src/make_auto_md_h.cc:

	Temporary fix for automatic header generation for supergeneric
	methods with explicit type. Proper fix is to get rid of the
	SUPPRESSHEADER macro in methods.cc completely and automatically
	determine which headers to generate. Will implement this as soon as
	time permits.

2012-06-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-146

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_griddedfield_gridname):

	Add check to verify the name of a grid in a GriddedField.

2012-06-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-145

	* This commit finishes what I plan regarding inputting and
	restructuring around surface RT-properties. (To fix handling of
	surface topography remains. That is, surface roughness can be
	incorporated, but overall angular tilt of the surface is not
	considered.)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/create_gfields.m: Data for
	test below had incorrect dimensions.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: Now
	includes test of WSM below.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_reflectivityFromGriddedField6): New WSM.

	* src/xml_io_instantiation.h: 
	* src/xml_io_types.h:

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/create_gfields.m: Created.
	Generates test data for TestSurface.arts.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: Extended
	to cover more cases, including the new WSM below.

	* src/m_surface.cc (complex_nFromGriddedField4): Created.

2012-06-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-143

	* src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Better fix for arts-2-1-142. Help some linkers to properly resolve
	dependencies between the static libs by adding agenda_record.cc to
	the methods library.

	* src/agenda_class.cc: Revert workaround from arts-2-1-142.

	* src/file.cc (find_file):

	If search paths are empty, at least check if the file exists before
	failing... Fixes test_binaryio testcase.

2012-06-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-142

	* src/agenda_class.cc:

	Add temporary workaround to (hopefully) fix crazy linker errors
	in test_binaryio and friends on Ubuntu.

	* arts-2-1-139

	* Further work on the surface. emission_agenda renamed to
	blackbody_radiation_agenda. Sufrace methods now use this agenda.
	This means that clearsky calculations now really work with the
	emission source term set to T (instead of B), or alternative
	version of Planck. (Standard Planck still hard-coded inside DOIT
	and MC).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs_fast.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.arts:

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt: Added surface test. Moved
	absorption to top as most basic test (among Components).

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/surface/TestSurface.arts: New.
	(Testing without any real atmospheric RT calculations!)

	and set false to default.

	* src/special_interp.cc (interp_gfield3): Removed. Not used. And
	used special definitions. In addition, should have been implemented
	as a class function.

	declaration failed.

2012-06-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-134

	* src/workspace.cc: Added that lon_grid can max span 360 deg. 

2012-06-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-133

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Improved a comment.

	* arts-2-1-132

	* src/m_surface.cc (surface_scalar_reflectivityFromGriddedField4):
	Almost complet version (not tested practically).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Modified, adopted to
	pos2true_latlon.

	* src/rte.cc (pos2true_latlon): Created.

	* src/workspace.cc: Tried to improve description of refellipsoid,
	lat_true and lon_true.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_latlon_true): Check for lon_true and 2D
	was incorrect. Now just perform checking (output arguments removed).

2012-06-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-131

	* src/methods.cc

	Add generic input 'dimension' to append functions. Passing in
	'leading' means to append to the leftmost dimension (e.g. rows for
	Matrix), 'trailing' to the rightmost (==cols).

	Add support to append single elements to arrays.

	Add support for Matrix.

	* src/groups.cc, src/wsv_aux.h (get_array_groups_as_string):

	Extend to return only Arrays whose basetype is a group and to return
	names of the basetypes of arrays only.

	* src/m_append.h:

	Implement append for Matrix.

2012-06-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-130

	* src/gridded_fields.h:

	Add checksize_strict member function that throws a runtime error with
	additional information on the grid and data sizes.

	Make checksize pure virtual in abstract base class.

	Remove redundant function documentation from subclasses. Doxygen
	automatically uses the docs from the base class.

	* src/gridded_fields.{cc,h}: Fix copyright header. Formatting.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream):

	Use checksize_strict for GriddedFields.

2012-06-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-129

	* src/m_surface.cc (InterpSurfaceEmissivityFieldIncLatLon): Removed.

	(surface_scalar_reflectivityFromGriddedField4): Just a start ...

	* src/m_surface.cc: Removed .h-files and "extern const" not used.

2012-06-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-128

	* A first step in revising the surface RT properties part. Main
	change here is that methods taking emissivity as input are removed.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceFlatReflectivity): Old method renamed,
	see below. This version ghanldes a general reflectivity matrix.
	Not yet tested practically.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/doitbatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/amsu/amsub_fast.arts:
	* controlfiles/instruments/mhs/mhs.arts:

	surfaceFlatReflectivity with surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity.

	* src/m_surface.cc (surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity): Renamed
	surfaceFlatReflectivity. Now only stokes_dim = 1 accepted.

	(surfaceFlatSingleEmissivity):
	(surfaceFlatVaryingEmissivity): Both removed. Use instead
	surfaceFlatScalarReflectivity.

	* src/workspace.cc (define_wsv_data): Added surface_reflectivity.
	Changed text for complex_n, to always demand two columns. Some
	polishing of text for core surface RT variables.

2012-06-14  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-127

	* src/parameters.cc: Fix baseurl parameter.

2012-06-14  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-126

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc: Reading of GriddedField2 was broken.

2012-06-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-125

	* src/messages.h:

	Remove ; from the end of the CREATE_OUT* macros. This forces a ; to be
	added when the macro is used to make it look like a statement (which
	it is). Also fixes automatic indentation in some editors that get
	confused if a statement doesn't end with a semicolon.

	* src/*.{cc,h}: Add semicolons to CREATE_OUT* calls.

	* src/agenda_{class,record}.{cc,h}: Reindent.

	* src/arts.cc (arts_exit_with_error_message): Remove extra block.

2012-06-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-123

	* src/parameters.{cc,h}:

	Add outdir parameter and commandline option -o/--outdir.

	Change commandline argument -B to -U.

	* src/file.{cc,h}:

	Add add_basedir function.

	(open_output_file): Catch file exceptions and rethrow as runtime_error
	with additional info about the filename.

	* src/main.cc:

	No need to catch ios_base exception anymore. Handled in
	open_output_file now.

	* src/xml_io.cc, src/nc_io.cc:

	Use add_basedir in writing functions.

	* src/arts.cc (arts_exit): Use add_basedir for report file path.

2012-05-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-122

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Updated. Now treating the new 3D
	scheme (old scheme commented out).

2012-05-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-121

	* src/ppath.cc: New 3D code now made active. Now yet fully tested
	for non-spherical conditions (but no known loophole as for old
	scheme). Tell me if you run into some problems.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_refr_3d): Finally managed to track down
	another bug. Again a stupid typo. r16a and and r16b were written
	as r15a and r15b.

2012-05-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-120

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Fixed a typo. Had written lat in
	one function call where it should have been lon.

2012-05-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-119

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Fixed some typos, and updated to
	recent changes for refraction.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_2d): Zenith and nadir cases
	handled completly seperately (more effecient and more clear code).

	(plevel_crossing_3d): Changed to mimic 2D version as far as
	possible.

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestPpath3D.arts: Last part of
	test reactivated. Changes below fixed the bug.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_3d_linear_basic): Handling of
	out-of-bounds za and aa angles was not correct. Now using
	adjust_los for this task.

	* src/rte.h: Added adjust_los.

	* src/rte.cc (adjust_los): Typo in header text.

2012-05-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-118

	* src/*, doc/uguide/arts*.tex: Update copyright year.

2012-05-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-117

	* src/docserver.* src/nc_io*, src/xml_io*:

	Reindent. Align & and * with type instead of variable.

2012-05-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-116

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Handle compiler options more gracefully. Instead of hardcoding them
	for different compilers, check if the current compiler supports the
	flag. If not, just ignore it.

	Set and check flags separately for C and C++ compiler.

	For Xcode project, pass active configuration name to ctest so it can
	select the correct executable.

	* cmake/modules/ArtsAddCompilerFlag.cmake: Added.

	* src/libmicrohttpd/CMakeLists.txt, src/CMakeLists.txt:

	Little tweak for clang.

2012-05-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-115

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h, src/nc_io_compound_types.cc, src/m_abs.cc,
	src/nc_io_types.h, src/nc_io.h, src/nc_io_basic_types.cc, src/m_nc.h,
	src/nc_io_instantiation.h, src/nc_io_array_types.cc, src/nc_io.cc:

	Change prefix of arts netcdf related functions from nc_ to nca_ to
	avoid confusion with functions from the netcdf library.

	* src/nc_io.{cc,h}: Add more helper functions. Add docs.

	* src/nc_io_compound_types.cc (nca_write_to_file):

	Clean up GasAbsLookup function.

	* doc/doxygen/Doxyfile.in: Add ENABLE_NETCDF to PREDEFINED macros.

2012-05-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-114

	* src/poly_roots.cc (gsl_poly_complex_solve): Removed screen
	message when bad convergence. This should be handled by calling
	function. Message left for the other (basic) errors.

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Increased standard n value to
	6. The function now adopts to poor poly_root-convergence. If this
	happens, n is decreased until convergence is achieved.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_2d): Before did not check upper
	pressure level if a hit with the surface had been found, to save
	time. Found not OK with high surface radial slope. Fixed.

	(plevel_crossing_2d): Removed assert at end, that checked
	consistency with geompath. Why compare to a poorer calculation?

2012-05-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-113

	* src/nc_io.cc (nc_read_from_file, nc_write_to_file):

	Add a try-catch-block to the template functions around the actual
	type-specific read/write function call. Catch exceptions, add current
	filename and re-throw.

	* src/nc_io_compound_types.cc (nc_read_from_file):

	Throw runtime_error if no species are found in the GasAbsLookup input
	file.

	(nc_write_to_file): Throw runtime_error no species are in the current
	GasAbsLookup table.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h, src/nc_io_compound_types.cc,
	src/nc_io_types.h, src/nc_io_basic_types.cc, src/nc_io_array_types.cc,
	src/nc_io.cc:

	Add Verbosity argument to nc_read_from_file and nc_write_to_file.

2012-05-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-112

	* src/nc_io_compound_types.cc:

	Add NetCDF reading/writing for GasAbsLookup.

	* src/methods.cc: Add GasAbsLookup to Read/WriteNetCDF.

	* src/gas_abs_lookup.h: Some love for abs_lookup by adding friends.

	* src/nc_io.{cc,h}: Add helper functions.

2012-05-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-111

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_surface): Checks for 3D cases
	covering North and South pole were missing. Added.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_2d): Output l was not calculated
	correctly if the level crossing is on other side of a tangent
	point. This seems not to happen inside the atmosphere, but can
	happen with a highly tilted surface. So this bug appeared only if
	the tangent point is just above a surface with high radial slope.
	Accordingly, showed up first after +300k of test cases!

2012-05-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-110

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Changed dza from 10 to 15 deg
	as limit for when going down from n=5 to n=4. Found one case of bad
	convergence for dza=10.7 (after running about 80000 cases).

2012-05-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-109

	* controlfiles/CMakeLists.txt:

	Install controlfiles/ into CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/arts/

	* CMakeLists.txt: Remove tests/ from subdirectories.

2012-05-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-108

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d): Had commited with new test 3D
	code active.

2012-05-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-107

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Now n=5 default (with both
	terms included), and no special treatment of za=90 needed. Now
	going down to n=1 for za [89.9,90].

2012-05-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-106

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Setting of dmin adjusted.
	Added comments to document the selection of some settings.

	(plevel_crossing_2d): Changed back to set r as rpl+cpl*dlat.
	Bad decision to change. Further tests showed that the numerical
	problems were on the other side, in geompath.

2012-04-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-105

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestPpath3D.arts:
	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestPpath2D.arts: Added several
	pos/los combinations, particularly for testing ray tracing along
	lat and lon grid positions. Also, now run with both spherical and
	non-spherical ellipsoid.

	3D non-spherical ellipsoid + refraction not active as it fails!

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/ppath/TestPpath1D.arts: Added a
	nadir from space case.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_init_structure): Start pos and los set to
	-999, to more clearly indicate non-valid data.
	
	(rslope_crossing2d): Now the polynomial degree is selected
	according to the zenith angle, to avoid (different) numerical
	problems around 0, 90 and 180. 

2012-04-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-104

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Updated with respect to change in
	rslope_crossing2d (now three terms in Taylor expansion of cos and
	sin).

2012-04-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-103

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex: Some typos fixed.

	* doc/uguide/surface.tex: Part on geodetic latitude shortened.
	Spell-checking.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex (section{The propagation path data
	structure}): Updated with ngroup, start_lstep and end_lstep.

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing3d): Now using 2D version if c2=0.
	Required by poly_root_solve.

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing2d): Taylor expansion of cos and
	sin now includes also the third term. Was found to improve the
	accuracy significantly with non-spherical ellipsoid.

	(plevel_crossing_2d): New r now calculated by geompath function,
	instead as r+c*dlat. This looks the path to ppc, which improves
	the accuracy.

2012-04-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-102

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing3d): New function.

	(plevel_crossing_3d): Now using rslope_crossing3d.

	* src/rte.cc (get_iy_of_background): Adopted to changes below.

	* src/ppath.cc: Changes in several functions to adopt to the
	changes below.
	(plevel_slope_2d): Converted c1 from return to out
	parameter.
	(plevel_slope_3d): Now fitting local radius as a second order
	polynomial. Results now returned by reference.

2012-04-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-101

	* src/ppath.cc: Introduced the terms r0s etc. to avoid repeating
	calculations.

2012-04-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-100

	* src/ppath.cc: Restarted the postponed work to finish the new 3D
	code. The relevant parts copied back from ppath_NotUsed.arts.
	Added code to handle zanith&/nadir cases seperately. Some tests.
	Seems like that accuracy of plevel_crossing_3d must be improved.

	* src/geodetic.cc (latlon_at_aa): New function.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Added missing space in
	error message.

2012-04-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-99

	* controlfiles/general/general.src: refr_index_group initiated to 1.

	* arts/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Extra path delay now calculated with
	ppath.ngroup (all below to fix this).

	* src/refraction.cc:
	* src/m_refraction.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc: Changes throughout the files to handle
	refr_index_group.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2):
	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepRefractionBasic)
	(VectorZtanToZaRefr1D): Changes associated with refr_index_group.

	* src/agendas.cc: refr_index_agenda has now also refr_index_group
	as output.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added refr_index_group.

2012-04-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-98

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexFreeElectrons): Now including a
	test with respect to the plasma frequency. And now returning the
	"proper" refractive index (here a value below 1), corresponding to
	the phase speed which is required for the ray tracing. How to
	handle path delays is an open question?

2012-04-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-97

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexFreeElectrons): It was just
	sqrt(...). Corrected to 1/sqrt(...)

	* controlfiles/artscomponents/radiolink/TestRadioLink.arts: Now
	finer p_grid and cubic interpolation in AtmFieldsCalc.

	* src/m_ppath.cc:(ppathFromRtePos2): Azimuth angle now also stored
	in H. Fine-tuning of settings for surface intersections.

	* src/refraction.cc: Full WSV of t_field and vmr_field now used
	inside functions for refraction (for consistency + to handle empty
	vmr_field).

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_field): Now also handling the case
	when the Tensor4 is/shall be empty.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Call chk_atm_field
	even if abs_species is empty.

2012-04-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-96

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog-archived:

	Move all pre 2-0-0 entries to ChangeLog-archived.

	* ChangeLog-20071207: Renamed to ChangeLog-archived.

2012-04-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-95

	* controlfiles/instruments/smr: Moved from includes/smr/.

	* includes/: Removed.

2012-04-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* src/workspace.cc: Introduced iy_variable and iy_aux_variable.

2012-04-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-93

	* This commit concludes the consolidation of controlfiles and
	includefiles into the controlfiles/ directory.

	Only open issue is the includes/smr directory. These files do not seem
	to be used anywhere. I left them in their original location for now.

	* src/file.{h,cc} (find_file):

	Don't go through search paths if filename already contains a full path.

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_from_file,xml_read_arts_catalogue_from_file): 

	Throw runtime error immediately when we know the file doesn't exist
	instead of later when trying to actually open it.

	* src/parameters.cc (get_parameters): Add . to include and data paths.

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::parse_agenda):

	When including a file with a path, we have to add the file's path
	temporarily at the beginning of the include path. This is necessary
	because the included file can include files from the same directory
	without specifying further path information. This mimics the behaviour
	how C/C++ compilers deal with include files. Problem is that we have to
	permanently add this path also to the data search path because include
	files can contain ReadXML etc. methods which are only executed later on.
	Not sure what a clean solution for that would be. #49

	* Missed to move two remaining controlfiles from tests/ in previous
	commit:

	* controlfiles/instruments/hirs: Moved from tests/HIRS.

2012-04-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-88

	* Starting to move and rearrange controlfiles from tests/ to
	controlfiles. I'll do that in several steps to avoid mayhem.

2012-04-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-87

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::parse_method_args):

	Bug fix. When the controlfile contained a call to a WSM that has
	generic output but all arguments were omitted, all hell broke lose.
	Try this controlfile with an older version ;-): Arts2 { ReadXML }

	Change exception type from UnexpectedChar to ParseError for
	missing generic inputs.

	(ArtsParser::parse_main):

	Instead of calling arts_exit directly in case of errors, rethrow the
	exception.

	* src/main.cc (main):

	Add a try catch block inside the main controlfile loop and add the
	current controlfile name to the error output.

2012-04-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-86

	* README: Updated. Add section headings. Add ctest documentation.

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	'make check' only runs quick controlfiles now. 'make check-all' runs
	all tests.

	Add cmake option TEST_JOBS to let user specify how many tests to be
	run in parallel. (cmake -DTEST_JOBS=4 ..)

	* cmake/modules/FindNetCDF.cmake:

	Netcdf library might also be called netcdf4/netcdf_c++4.

2012-04-12  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-85

	* src/cloudbox.cc:
	- use SI units with all pnd calculation functions.
	- remove (use of) scale_H11. let chk_pndsum do the work, which anyway
	  did the same plus some warnings.
	- corrected (?!) scaling in MP48 (we don't have a direct way to check
	  scaling based on precip rate. need to derive and use mass density
	  instead).
	- removed hard coded density of particles in cloud liquid PSD (H98).

	* src/cloudbox.h: adapted.

2012-04-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-84

	* tests/RadioLink/TestRadioLink.arts: Now checking atmospheric
	loss and extra path delay.

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing_general_sub): 1D calculations around
	zenith/nadir requires special treatment.
	
	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_euler): The law of cosines was
	used to calculate new latitude, which wasfound to be numerically
	unstable around zenith and nadir. Now using combination of
	geompath functions, that seems to work much better.

	(raytrace_2d_linear_euler): As above.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc): Code replaced by call of adjust_los.

2012-04-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-83

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Prepared for using
	defocusing_general but so far inactive. 

	* src/ppath.h: Added declaration of cart2zaaa and cart2zaaa.

	* src/rte.cc: Replaced a number of "const Xxxxx&" with
	"ConstXxxxxView" where Xxxx is Vector etc.

	(adjust_los): New function.

	(defocusing_general):
	(defocusing_sat2sat): Complete. The two version give somewhat
	different results but a perfect agreement can not be expected. So
	OK right now. More detailed tests later on.

	Fails at least for 1D cases corresponding to za=0.

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_1d_linear_euler): Added an if-statement
	to handle poor accuracy for latitude when zenith angle = 0 or 180.

2012-04-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-82

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Defocusing was not correctly iniated
	and applied.

	* src/rte.cc (defocusing3d, defocusing_limb1d): Started on two
	different aproaches to calculate defocusing. Not working and not
	active.

	* src/m_general.cc (Print): 
	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream)
	(xml_write_to_stream): Adopted to end/start_lstep.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (PrintTangentPoint): Now using find_tanpoint.
	(ppathFromRtePos2): Adopted to end/start_lstep.

	* src/ppath.cc: Adopted to end/start_lstep.
	(find_tanpoint): New function.

	* src/ppath.h (struct Ppath): lspace removed. start_lstep and
	end_lstep introduced. (lspace was the sum of the two new fields,
	but this is not sufficient information for calculating
	defocusing).

2012-04-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-81

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Now calculating the bending angle
	correctly (for 1D, approximative for 2D and 3D).
	Now the quantity for both iy and iy_aux can be selected.

	* src/workspace.cc: Description of refr_index polished. 

	* src/absorption.cc (refr_index_BoudourisDryAir)
	(refr_index_Boudouris): Removed. Old. Not used. Should not be in
	this file.

	* src/rte.cc (bending_angle1d): New function.

	* src/geodetic.cc: double was still hard-coded in this function! 
	(sphdist): New function.
	
2012-04-05  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-80

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (pnd_fieldSetup):
	- moved all specific PSD calculation functionality into individual
	functions.
	- added Marshall&Palmer PSD for rain (also intended for use with snow,
	graupel/hail).
	- changed errors due to 'incorrect' profile or particle type
	into warnings, giving more freedom to the user how to name and combine
	things.

	* src/cloudbox.cc,cloudbox.h:
	added individual function for each implemented PSD type (currently:
	MH97, H11, H98_STCO, MP48).

2012-04-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-79

	* Switching to ctest!

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Use ctest as the default for the check/check-fast targets.

	* tests/testall.py:

	Remove all tests that moved to the ctest interface. Only one left
	that was currently not used due to a dependency on PyARTS. I'll leave
	the code here for now.

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake: Remove deprecated macros.

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add last missing test Wfuns.

	Remove deprecated testing code.

2012-04-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-78

	* tests/testall.py,
	tests/MonteCarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneralGaussian.arts,
	tests/MonteCarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts,
	tests/MonteCarlo/TestMonteCarloGeneral.arts:

	Move tests into the controlfiles.

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt: Add fast.odinsmr test.

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake:

	Set arts screen output level for tests to 0 to only output the error
	in case of failure instead of the whole method log.

2012-04-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-77

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): Extended. Now handling dispersion
	and iy_aux set. Auxiliary variable to return can be selected (as a
	temporary solution?).

	* src/rte.cc (get_ppath_rtvars): Now using f_index.
	(get_iy_of_background): Adopted to agenda changes.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc: Adopted call of iy_space_agenda. 

	* src/agendas.cc: f_grid new input for emission_agenda and
	iy_space_agenda. Needed to handle dispersion (and could be used to
	consider Doppler shift also for these terms).

	* src/workspace.cc: Introduced dispersion_do. 

2012-04-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-76

	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath3D.arts:
	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath2D.arts:
	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath1D.arts: Some changes. The files test
	different options for f_index = -1.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): Now also checking
	edensity_field.

	* includes/general.arts: edensity_field set to be empty. Adopted
	definition of ppath_step_agenda.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (iwp_cloud_opt_pathCalc):
	* src/m_rte.cc:
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCIPA):
	* src/m_fos.cc:
	* src/m_doit.cc:
	* src/doit.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc:
	* src/m_ppath.cc: Numerous changes due to changes below (but all
	basically only to hand over variables to next function in the chain).

	* src/agendas.cc: Added edensity_field and f_index as input to
	ppath_agenda and ppath_step_agenda (edensity_field is presently
	not needed as agenda input, just in case if we want edensity
	jacobians in the future. To finish this, edensity_field must be
	added as input to iy_clearsky_agenda.).

	Reverted change for ppath_agenda. rte_los now only input. Not
	needed as output now with end_los added to Ppath structure.

	* src/refraction.cc: All functions consider now f_index and
	edensity_field.

2012-04-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-75

	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_1/2/3d): Adopted call of
	refr_index_agenda, but so far just using local variables.

	* src/m_refraction.cc (refr_indexThayer): Now also doing the
	calculation (code moved from refr_index_thayer_1974). Works now in
	an additive way; refr_index is increased instead of set.
	(refr_indexIR): As above (but code from refr_index_ir).

	(refr_indexFreeElectrons): New WSM.

	(refr_indexUnit): Removed. Cfile even clearer if done as
	NumericSet( refr_index, 1.0 )

2012-04-03  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-73

	* CAREFUL! THIS COMMIT BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY!
	redefinition of part_species tag structure: third element now part_type
	(the material/phase of the individual particle as given in
	ScattMetaData, e.g., "Ice"), size selection shifted backwards. first
	element renamed part_type->prof_type (the type of particle bulk profile,
	e.g. "IWC").

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc, cloudbox.cc, src/cloudbox.h, m_atmosphere.cc:
	renamed (parse_)part_type -> (parse_)prof_type.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc:
	(cloudboxSetAutomatically): removed hardwired prof_type-to-position-in-
	massdensity_field relation.
	(ScatteringParticlesSelect): removed hardwired prof_type-to-part_type
	relation.
	(pnd_fieldSetup): allow "H98_STCO" and "STCO" as more appropriate PSD
	selection tags for the current liquid cloud psd (which is continental
	stratus from Hess98). currently used "liquid" to be removed in future.

	* src/cloudbox.cc:
	(parse_prof_type): removed hard-wired restrictions on allowed prof_type
	names.
	(parse_part_type): added. function to parse part_species for part_type,
	the material/phase of the individual
	particle (e.g., "Ice").

	* src/cloudbox.h: adapted acc. to cloudbox.cc changes

	* src/methods.cc, workspace.cc:
	descriptions of several particle related methods updated.

	adapted to new part_species structure.

2012-04-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-72

	* tests/RadioLink/TestRadioLink.arts: Updated. New target values
	include free space loss. Accuracy not effectively is fractional,
	as threshold set based on the reference value.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): ppath.end_pos/los set
	to match the transmitter.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Changes in several functions to
	handle and set new Ppath fields.

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt:

	Revert accidentally committed line that broke the clean target.

	Add TestMHS and TestMHS_fast to new tests.

2012-04-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-68

	* tests/RadioLink/TestRadioLink.arts: Somewhat more demanding for
	limb sounding. 

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): One of the tuning parameters
	had slipped back to an earlier, bad, value in the commit. 

2012-04-02  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-67

	* CAREFUL! THIS COMMIT BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY!
	'ChevalAll' batch routines removed (functionality merged into basic
	batch routines). Also impacts:
	- setup of part_species (number, order, and naming needs to fit particle
	field names passed to batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix - 
	equivalent to abs_species philosophy.)

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc
	(atm_fields_compactFromMatrix):
	- proper implementation of "ignore" (any columns, not only from the
	back, can be ignored now.)
	- now also to be used with batch atmospheres that include particle
	profiles. replaces atm_fields_compactFromMatrixChevalAll.

	(batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix):
	- added catch when batch atmosphere arrayofmatrix is empty (e.g., cause
	reading-in accidentially removed from control file).
	- now also to be used with batch atmospheres that include particle
	profiles. replaces batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrixChevalAll.

	(AtmFieldsFromCompact):
	- adapted such that now also to be used with batch atmospheres that
	include particle profiles. replaces AtmFieldsFromCompactChevalAll.
	- added massdensity_field and part_species as input parameters.
	- non-hardwired handling of particle profiles (number, order, naming
	have to correspond to part_species definition. like vmr profiles to
	abs_species).

	(atm_fields_compactFromMatrixChevalAll,
	 batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrixChevalAll,
	 AtmFieldsFromCompactChevalAll): removed.

	* src/methods.cc
	(atm_fields_compactFromMatrixChevalAll,
	 batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrixChevalAll,
	 AtmFieldsFromCompactChevalAll): removed.
	(atm_fields_compactFromMatrix,
	 batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix,
	 AtmFieldsFromCompact): adapted.

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc
	(ScatteringParticlesSelect):
	- throw error, when particle profile given, but no corresponding
	ScattData in selection.
	- replace error when no ScattData selected by a warning (should only
	occur when part_species empty, which occurs when using batch
	atmospheres, but having/wanting no particle profiles).
	- commented out check, whether all ScattData got selected (meaning
	of check unclear as well as whether it at all works as intended).

	(pnd_fieldSetup):
	- remove hardwiring of position of certain hydrometeor in
	massdensity_field and fixed link between particle profile type (IWC,
	LWC, etc.) and PSD. it's responsibility of the user to ensure profile
	type and PSD fit together (i.e., user here can now apply MH97 on LWC -
	not tested throughout, though. there might be further places hardwiring
	profile type and PSD relations.)!
	- catch case with no actual particles/ScattData linked to the particular
	part_species (though should never occur anymore, since already catched
	in ScatteringParticlesSelect
	- throw error, when given PSD is unknown

	* src/cloudbox.cc
	(chk_pndsum): added particle type (first part of part_species string) as
	input parameter, write clearer error message when pnd==0, but xwc!=0.

	(parse_psd_param): proper handling of incomplete part_species strings.
	remove check PSD validity here (now done in pnd_fieldSetup).

	* src/cloudbox.h (chk_pndsum): added part_type as passed parameter.

	* includes/general.arts: added part_species default setting (empty).
	required for AtmFieldsFromCompact for no-particle (i.e., clear-sky)
	batch cases.

	* tests/DOITBatch/TestDOITBatch.arts:
	adapted to new requirements (removed *ChevalAll calls, resorted
	part_species acc. to new requirements, ignore snow and rain).

2012-04-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-66

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt: Added RadioLink case. Placed transmission
	type cases (Transmission+RadioLink) between basic emission cases
	and the scattering cases.

	* tests/RadioLink/TestRadioLink.arts: Complete. (But calculations
	seems unstable, something is wrong. So far limb sounding case set
	to be simple.)

	* cmake/modules/ArtsTestcases.cmake:

	Add convenience macros to create controlfile based tests.

	* tests/CMakeLists.txt:

	Add more new tests and use new macro to create them. MC test cases
	still need the check against reference values implemented.

	* src/xml_io.cc
	(xml_read_from_file,xml_read_arts_catalogue_from_file):

	Make sure we read the .bin file from the same path as the .xml file.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Tweak newcheck-fast.

2012-04-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-63

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyRadioLink): New WSM. So far just calculating the
	transmission (jacobians and iy_aux not yet handled). But first
	complete radio link calculations!

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): A complete version.

	* src/ppath.cc: Several functions adopted to change of ppath_copy.

	(ppath_copy): Handles now also partial copying of
	ppath2.

	(ppath_calc): Now completely silent. The output just makes it hard
	to get good reports from the WSM using this function. So moving
	the reporting to the WSMs.
	
2012-04-01  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-1-62

	* src/cloudbox.cc: some formatting for better readability.

	(IWCtopnd_MH97): MH97 PSD with noisy distribution parameters (gaussian
	noise according to error statistics given in MH97 paper). untested for
	stability, correct output etc. (but not breaking existing setups), so
	use with care.

	(scale_pnd): bugfix. for monodisperse case (no	integration) set pnd=dN.

	* src/cloudbox.h (IWCtopnd_MH97): adapted for noisy MH97 (see above).

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: some formatting for better readability.

	(pnd_fieldSetup): adapted for noisy MH97 (see above).

	* src/mc_antenna.cc (ran_gaussian): fixed typo.

2012-03-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-61

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Combined check of cloudbox_on and
	ppath_inside_cloudbox_do lacked a !. Added some assert for extra
	safety when running with ppath_inside_cloudbox_do set to true.

	(ppath_start_stepping): Also points on the cloudbox boundary are
	now flagged as inside cloudbox. That is, no start poinst can end
	up as "cloudbox boundary". This made the code shorter and avoids
	unsafe calculations of pressure levels tilts (the code was not
	complete on this point). Thos closed one point in TODO.

2012-03-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-60

	* tests/PencilBeam/TestPencilBeam.arts: mblock_index now needed to

2012-03-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-59

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/CMakeLists.txt, tests/CMakeLists.txt:

	Started utilizing the ctest facility of cmake. Should make it much
	easier to integrate tests in the future. Also, the output looks very
	clean compared to now.

	If you want to give it a try, run 'make newcheck' in the toplevel of
	the build directory. Note that only one controlfile is run at the
	moment. More to come.

2012-03-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-58

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Still not complete, but a
	core algorith now established (after several tries).

	* src/geodetic.cc (line_circle_intersect,line_sphere_intersect):
	New functions.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_rte_pos): What now is rte_pos[2] was
	rte_pos[1].

	tests from testall.py.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc, src/methods.cc: Add WSM NumericCompare.

	* src/parameters.cc (get_parameters):

	Fix crash for arts calls with no controlfile.

	to the includepath.

2012-03-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-53
	
	* src/main.cc (main):

	Bugfix: If arts was called with a relative or full path to a
	controlfile, report files and output data with default filenames were
	written into the directory of the controlfile instead of the current
	directory.

2012-03-29  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-52

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (AtmFieldsCalc):

	Add 1D support for VMR input profiles that do not cover the whole
	range of the target grid. Boundary values in the partial input profile
	must be 0.

	* src/check_input.{cc,h} (chk_interpolation_grids_loose):

	Add new check used by AtmFieldsCalc to determine the range of the
	new grid that is covered by the old grid. Also checks that boundary
	values are 0 in the input data.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc, src/methods.cc (VectorCompare, MatrixCompare):

	Make implementation and error output of both methods consistent. Add
	an optional String argument for passing a custom error message.

2012-03-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-51

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Complete, but not always
	converging :-(  Will be fixed ...

	(rte_losGeometricFromRtePosToRtePos2): Now using pos2refell_r
	(making the function much shorter).

	(PrintTangentPoint): New WSM.

	* src/geodetic.cc (pos2refell_r): Was not OK for 3D. Had to add
	check with respect to lon_grid.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceIPA):
	* src/rte.cc (get_iy_of_background):
	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_3d, get_refr_index_2d):
	Replaced call of refell2r with refell2d (to be fully conistent
	with model definitions).

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE):
	* src/doit.cc (cloud_ppath_update3D): Added comments that using
	refell2r is OK.

2012-03-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* tests/RadioLink/TestRadioLink.arts: Start on a new test cfile.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathFromRtePos2): Further work ...

	* src/geodetic.cc (pos2refell_r): New function.

	* src/geodetic.h: Declaration of distance2D was incorrect.

2012-03-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-49

	* Same changes as for arts-2-0-40:

	* tests/Wfuns/TestWfuns.arts:
	* tests/GroundBased/TestGbased.arts:
	* tests/ClearSky/TestClearSky.arts: Adopted call of
	jacobianAddFreqShiftAndStretch.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianAddFreqShiftAndStretch): df now
	carefully checked, to not give rise to an assert in interpolation
	applied in function below. f_grid had to be added is input.

	(jacobianCalcFreqShiftAndStretchInterp): The extrapolation factor
	for gridpos_poly now set to 1 (default of 0.5 was used before).

	(jacobianAddPointingZa): Added check that dza is inside [0,0.1],
	to avoid that unnecessary large values are used.

2012-03-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-48

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): Expression for dlat can
	return NaN. If isnan, then set 0.
	Added also an if-statement to brake what can be become an infinite
	loop at tangent points.
	(This fixes so that test cfiles TestPpath1/2/3D.arts also run OK)
	(with refraction.)

2012-03-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-47

	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath1/2/3D.arts: Updated. Now using ppathCalc.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometric,ppath_stepRefractionEuler):
	The case when called just to get nreal catched and handled seperately.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping, ppath_calc): nreal was not
	always set for ppath having a single point.
	(do_gridcell_2d): Reintroduced some code to set exact value for
	zenith angle and latitude (when known). A case where numerical
	problems moved the latitude 1e-13 deg (!) outside the grid box was
	found.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Reintroduced this WSM, but now
	calling ppath_agenda (instead of ppath_calc).

2012-03-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-46

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_field): Added check that 3D fields are
	constant with longitude for latitudes of +-90 deg (N- and S-pole).

	* src/m_ppath.cc (rte_losGeometricFromRtePosToRtePos2): New WSM
	(not yet heaviliy tested).
	(ppathFromRtePos2): Started on this WSM.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Now using the two new functions below.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_rte_pos,chk_rte_los): New functions.

2012-03-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-45

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathToTransmitter): Just moved the (unused)
	code from ppath.cc to this file.

	* src/geodetic.cc (los2xyz): New function.

	* tests/MonteCarlo/TestRteCalcMC.arts: Added Ignore(mblock_index) to
	definition of iy_clearsky_agenda.

	* includes/general.arts: Added Ignore(mblock_index) and
	Touch(rteLlos) to definition of ppath_agenda.

	* src/rte.cc:
	* src/m_fos.cc:
	* src/m_rte.cc: Adopted to new agenda input described below.
	mblock_index is applied only for first part of rt calculation.
	That is, not inside cloudbox or after surface reflection
	(iy_clearsky_agenda or ppath_agenda is here given -1).

	* src/agendas.cc: Added mblock_index as input to
	iy_clearsky_agenda and ppath_agenda. rte_los added as output for
	ppath_agenda (needed to obtain bending angles for radio links).

	* src/workspace.cc: Added transmitter_pos and rte_pos2.

	* src/m_rte.cc:
	* src/m_sensor.cc:
	* src/rte.cc:
	* src/methods.cc:
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:
	* src/agendas.cc: imblock -> mblock_index.

	* src/workspace.cc: Renamed imblock to mblock_index (to fit naming
	pattern of f_index ybach_index ...).

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Re-reverted (not just a
	workaround, in fact also a bit safer with respect to ending up
	with asserts).

2012-03-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-44

	* src/make_auto_md_cc.cc:

	Bugfix in auto-generated agendaExecute code. Even if a variable is only
	used as WSM output inside the current agenda, it is possible that it is
	used first as input further down by another nested agenda, which we
	can't see here. Therefore initialized variables have to be duplicated.
	Also, non-initialized WSM output-only variables were falsely flagged as
	initialized. Fixes bug reported by patrick.

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_doit.cc:

	Reverted patrick's workaround for the above bug from arts-2-1-42.

	* src/docserver.cc (Docserver::new_page):

	Fixed crash with new libc++. tokens.erase(tokens.end()) never did what
	it was meant to do (because end() is not a pointer to the last element,
	but behind it). Statement has no effect with the old libstdc++.
	Now replaced with the correct call tokens.pop_back();

2012-03-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-43

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianCalcTemperaturePerturbations): 
	molarmass_dry_air required for HSE calculations.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Now using
	molarmass_dry_air, and could potentially be used for planets
	beside Earth. The description (in methods.cc) updated.

	* includes/general.arts: molarmass_dry_air set to 28.966.

	* src/workspace.cc: Added molarmass_dry_air.

	* tests/PencilBeam: New folder with a simple test of monochromatic
	pencil beam calculations.

	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath1/2/3D.arts: Changed paths to files to work
	as (future) test cases.

2012-03-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-42

	* tests/DOITBatch/TestDOITBatch.arts: Moved up call of
	basics_checkedCalc and cloudbox_checkedCalc, to be placed before
	CloudboxGetIncoming. (This was already the case in TestDOIT.arts)

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming): Now checking if
	basics_checked and cloudbox_checked are set to true.

2012-03-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-41

	* ppath_agenda introduced. With the exceptions: Not relevant for
	DOIT (inside cloudbox). Nothing changed for MC (as other
	ppath_step part is anyhow hard-coded inside MC).

	* Clean-up/bugfix regarding input to ppath_step_agenda and
	iy_clearsky_agenda. Caused changes in several files (list below
	probably not complete). If general.arts used, no changes should be
	needed.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometricUpDown): Removed. More
	complete tests showed that for complete simulations the time gain
	is very small and then better to remove a method of such low
	generality.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc (ppath_geom_updown_1d): Now placed here.

	* includes/general.arts: Now also defining ppath_agenda and
	ppath_inside_cloudbox_do.

	* src/workspace.cc: ppath_cloudbox_do was incorrectly declared as
	Numeric. Also renamed to ppath_inside_cloudbox_do, for better
	clarity. N.B., this is a variable that standard usage not need to
	consider. Just use value set in general.arts!

	* src/ppath.cc: Replaced outside_cloudbox with ppath_inside_cloudbox_do.

	* src/montecarlo.cc:
	* src/m_montecarlo.cc:
	* src/m_rte.cc:
	* src/m_jacobian.cc:
	* src/m_fos.cc: Adopted to agenda changes below.

	* src/agendas.cc (ppath_step_agenda): A bug found! Added t_field,
	z_field and vmr_field as agenda input. This is required for
	jacobian perturbation calculations, to allow that e.g.
	t-disturbances can affect the refractive index.

	(iy_clearsky_agenda): Removed p/lat/lon_grid as input. These
	variables were added to handle FOS-2D, but realises that these
	variables must be pushed own to ppath_step_agenda level to work.
	And also other variables must be passed on from agenda to agenda
	for totally correct results. How to handle this is a later issue!

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z2g): Removed another pow.

2012-03-23  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-40

	* src/file.cc (find_file):

	~ was not expanded properly for include paths passed by the -I
	commandline option.

2012-03-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-39

	* src/workspace.cc: Defined ppath_cloudbox_do. This WSV correponds
	to the ppath_calc input argument outside_cloudbox (but equals
	!outside_cloudbox).

	* src/agendas.cc: Defined ppath_agenda.

	* src/refraction.cc (refr_index_ir): As below + declared constants
	as static.

	* src/geodetic.cc (distance3D,distance3D): As below.

	* src/physics_funcs.cc: Replaced usage of pow with
	multiplications, eg. pow(f,3.0) -> f*f*f. To hopefully gain some
	calculation time.

2012-03-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-38

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_to_transmitter): New function. Just started.

2012-03-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-37

	* src/physics_funcs.cc: Removed all hard-coding of double.

2012-03-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-36

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2pol, ..., distance2D,distance3D): 2D
	version of existing 3D ones completed. And added functions for
	calculating the distance between two points.

2012-03-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-35

	* src/geodetic.cc: Started to make 2D versions of the functions,
	ie. pol2cart etc.

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCompareToReference): Renamed. See below. This as
	this version was unneceesarily tied to y, and to complement the
	existing matrixCompare WSM.

	* src/m_basic_types.cc (VectorCompare): The method above renamed
	and made more general (all input generic).

	* tests/Ppath/TestPpath1/2/3D.arts: ppathCalc replaced by
	ppathStepByStep.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Renamed (to make a better
	distinction to other ppath methods (to be created), calculating
	complete ppaths).
	(ppathStepByStep): New name of ppathCalc.

2012-03-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-34

	* src/workspace.cc: Stated dimension of diy_dx was wrong.

	* src/m_rte.cc (iyCalc, yFromIy,yCompareToReference): New WSMs.

	* src/rte.cc (iyb_calc,get_iy_of_background): Now placed in this file.
	(iyb_calc): Now using iyCalc.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (z_fieldFromHSE): Now using versions of the
	equations, and some changes to for efficiency. Chwecked to give
	same results as pt2z in atmlab.
	The only Earth specific setting now is average molecular weight of
	dry air. Shall this be a WSV or calculated from vmr_field (if
	constrain that sum up to 1 is introduced)?

	* src/m_ppath.cc: Removed EARTH_GRAV_CONST (not used).

	* src/constants.cc: Removed not used constants EARTH_GRAV_CONST,
	LOSCHMIDT_CONST, ATOMIC_MASS_UNIT, SUN_TEMP and PRES_STAND.
	Added GAS_CONST.
	Sorted alphabetically (beside when dependency demand other order).
	Set PI, DEG2RAD and RAD2DEG to value reported by matlab, with
	"format long". That gave for all three constants one digit more
	compared to old value (no change for already existing digits).

2012-03-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-33

	* tests/Wfuns/TestWfuns.arts: Updated according to changes in last
	commit.

2012-03-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-32

	* tests/GroundBased/TestGbased.arts: Added definition of lat_true.

	* src/m_jacobian.cc (jacobianCalcTemperaturePerturbations):
	Adopted call of z_fieldFromHSE, that required adding input vars.

	* includes/general.arts: Added definition of g0_agenda.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc: Some methods moved to m_planets.cc.

	(z_fieldFromHSE): Now using g0_agenda, lat_true and lon_true.
	A first step to make the function more general.

	* src/m_planets.cc: New file, for planet specific workspace
	methods. Some WSM from m_atmosphere moved here.

	(g0Earth): New WSM.

	* src/agendas.cc: Added g0_agenda.

	* src/workspace.cc: New WSVs: g0, lat, lat_true, lon and lon_true.
	Text for lat_grid and lon_grid updated, now (again) saying that
	they must be set to be empty when not used.

2012-03-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-31

	* src/ppath.cc: Many changes. In summary: Several bug fixes.
	Tests removed from several functions, for things now handled by
	cart2XXX in a general way. Revision of refraction part finished.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc (cart2poslos): Old version stored here.
	(cart2sph): Same here.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_slope_3d): cart2poslos was used when
	cart2pos suffices (where new version used).

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceIPA): Adopted to addition below.

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2poslos,cart2sph): Made a version of the
	functions with additional input. The new input is information of
	the original position, used to improve the accuracy.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_2d): Now making use of absza also
	inside the function (as originally planned). DEBUG_ONLY then
	removed.

2012-03-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-30

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_lines_per_speciesWriteToSplitArtscat):

	Don't crash for species that have no lines.

2012-03-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-29

	* src/methods.cc, src/m_abs.cc
	(abs_lines_per_speciesWriteToSplitArtscat):

	Add WSM to write a splitted ARTSCAT based on abs_lines_per_species.

	* src/xml_io_array_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream):

	Output some info to out2 about how many lines were actually read from
	the ARTSCAT. (read vs. total)

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromArts):

	out2 output moved to xml_read_from_stream because there we have access
	to the total number of lines in the catalog.

	* src/parser.cc (ArtsParser::read_name_or_value):

	Throw a ParseError instead of plain runtime_error for unsupported
	parameter types. This way it outputs information about the line number
	in the controlfile.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_2d):

	Use DEBUG_ONLY macro for definition of absza.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (lgamma_func):

	Remove warning about value being floored to 1 if compiled with
	Numeric==float as we don't support float anymore.

	* src/arts.h, src/m_abs.cc, src/xml_io_array_types.cc:

	Change my "FIXME OLE:" to "FIXME: OLE:" so they're recognized by
	Xcode.

2012-03-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-28

	* src/ppath.cc (raytrace_2d_linear_euler): Correction for
	refraction got a negative length if abs(za) > 90.

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Removed some typos and sentences
	describing old stuff. Added a clarification about the unit used
	for the lat/lon gradient of refractive index. Better placement of
	figures.

2012-03-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-27

	* src/ppath.cc: Work on code for refraction. Now complete, and
	works in the case of n=1 with an accuarcy better than 1 mm.
	Not yet tested for n>1.

2012-03-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-26

	* src/ppath.cc: Code for refraction cleaned up and chenged. The
	old length interpolation removed as it deteriorates the accuracy
	and anyhow makes the code slower. A lot of changes caused by this.

	3D with refraction not yet ready!

	(interpolate_raytracing_points)
	(from_raytracingarrays_to_ppath_vectors_1d_and_2d)
	(from_raytracingarrays_to_ppath_vectors_3d):
	(ppath_fill_1d, ppath_fill_2d, ppath_fill_3d): Removed or merged
	into other functions.

	(ppath_end_1d,ppath_end_2d,ppath_end_3d): Now also making "fill"
	and handles vector lstep and nreal.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc (refr_gradients_1d): Now placed here.

	* src/refraction.cc (get_refr_index_1d, get_refr_index_2d)
	(get_refr_index_3d, refr_gradients_2d, refr_gradients_3d):
	Converted rte_pressure, rte_temperature and rte_vmr_list from
	in/out/arguments to local variables (reminiscent from old agenda
	functionality).

2012-03-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-25

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Updated geomtrical 3D text to last
	changes.

	* src/ppath.cc: Resorted order of functions, to better seperate
	code for geometrical and refraction calculations.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc (za_geom2other_point): Now placed here.

2012-03-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-24

	* src/ppath.cc: Moved inactive parts to file below.

	* src/ppath_NotUsed.cc: New file. Storage for code from ppath.cc
	now not used.

2012-03-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-23

	* src/ppath.h: Moved RTOL and LATLONTOL to ppath.cc.

	* src/ppath.cc (do_gridcell_3d_byltest): Updated to new approach
	to handle tangent points. Then found a bug for path steps around
	tangent points for old code. "lstep" before and after tangent
	point not necessarily the same but function returned just a single
	value. Solved automatically by switch to new approach.

	Introduced LACC, and moved RTOL and LATLONTOL from ppath.h, as not
	used externally.

	* src/m_general.cc (Test): Removed old test code.

2012-03-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-22

	* src/rte.cc:
	* src/m_rte.cc:

	* src/m_fos.cc:
	* src/doit.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc:
	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc: Adopted to change below.

	* src/ppath.h: Changed back: l_step -> lstep and l_space -> lspace
	(to be consistent with the WSV ppath_lmax/raytrace).

	* doc/uguide/batch.tex: Updated the code example where
	ppath_stepGeometric is re-defined.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Updated regarding that sensor_pos now holds
	altitude instead of radius.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: A quick re-revision. Some less important
	comments removed.

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex: Some text improvements and updates.

	* src/geodetic.cc: Geiod -> ellipsoid in header.

	* src/ppath.cc: Part around PTILTMAX changed. Some more work on 3D
	code.

	* src/ppath.h: Removed version of plevel_slope_3d not used outside

	* arts-2-1-21

	* src/ppath.cc (lat_crossing_3d, r_crossing_3d): Yet another

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_3d): Now handling tangent points
	in the same way as 1D and 2D functions.

	(r_crossing_3d): Added special handling of r_hit==r_start.

2012-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-19

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_3d): Forgot to switch back to old
	version of do_gridcell_3d. (Now checks run with OK.)

2012-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-18

	* src/ppath.cc (r_crossing_3d, lat_crossing_3d, lon_crossing_3d):
	Now complete versions.

2012-02-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-17

	* src/ppath.cc: Some work on new 3D code.

	(lat_crossing_3d,lon_crossing_3d): New functions. Not yet complete.

2012-02-28  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-16

	* src/m_abs.cc (abs_linesReadFromSplitArtscat):

	If basename is a directory (path ends with '/'), don't append
	'.SPECIES.xml' but just 'SPECIES.xml'.

	* src/xml_io_array_types.cc (xml_read_from_stream):

	Fix regression for reading ArrayOfLineRecord from an ARTS catalog whose
	version number is just "3" instead of "ARTSCAT-3".

	(xml_write_to_stream): When writing an ArrayOfLineRecord, determine
	the required catalog version from the first LineRecord. If the array
	contains a mixture of different versions of lines, throw a runtime
	error.

	* src/xml_io.cc (xml_read_from_file,
	xml_read_arts_catalogue_from_file):

	Output the _full_ filename to out2. Gives better feedback to the user
	if the file is found somewhere in the path (ARTS_DATA_PATH) instead of
	the current directory.

2012-02-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-15

	* ChangeLog: Was not saved at last commit.

2012-02-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-14

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Revision and extending general part
	of 3D geometrical calculations.

	* src/ppath.cc (gridcell_crossing_3d): Extracted this function
	from arts-1-1-400, for later use (now inside /* */).

	* src/geodetic.cc (cart2poslos): Just rearrangement to get dy and
	dz terms in logical order.

2012-02-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-12

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: General revision. Section on
	numerical precision removed. 2D geometrical section updated
	following changes in source code.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Even more sections moved to ATD. Text
	revised and updated.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc:
	* src/m_general.cc:
	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Adopted to change below.

	* src/ppath.h (struct Ppath): Renamed lspace to l_space (to be
	consistent with l_space).

2012-02-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-11

	* A first step of moving all path equations to ATD.

	* doc/uguide/arts_theory.tex:
	* doc/uguide/CMakeLists.txt: ppath_theory.tex added.

	* doc/uguide/ppath_theory.tex: Holds the part removed below. Not
	yet adopted to ATD.

	* doc/uguide/ppath.tex: Last part having a lot of equations moved
	to ATD.

	* doc/uguide/surface.tex: First two section revised, and slightly
	changed.

2012-02-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-10

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometricUpDown): Now working with an
	active cloudbox (realised that this method can be used with DOIT
	1D, if ppath-step_agenda is changed after the cloudbox radiation
	field is determined)

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_geom_updown_1d): Core part of change above
	done here.

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_2d): Removed old version of this
	function.

	* src/geodetic.cc (geomtanpoint,geomtanpoint2d): Deactivated, as
	not yet known if result is OK:

	* src/ppath.h:
	* src/ppath.cc: All special treatment of float removed.

2012-02-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-9

	* aii, CMakeLists.txt: Remove outdated IDL routines.

2012-02-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-8

	* CMakeLists.txt: Add a very clear warning if the user decides to
	compile with a custom Numeric type.

2012-02-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-7

	* src/ppath.h: Changed RTOL to 1e-3, LATLONTOL to 1e-8 and POLELAT
	to 90-1e-8. These all corresponds to an overall accuracy of about 1
	mm (for Earth).

2012-02-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-6

	* tests/GroundBased/TestGbased.arts: The new WSM below is now used
	by this case.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometricUpDown): New WSM. Provides
	much faster ppath calculations for 1D upward or downward cases.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_geom_updown_1d): New.

	* src/doit.cc:
	* src/m_doit.cc: z_surface removed as input to "update" methods,

2012-02-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-4

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing): Changed some limits for dlat.
	Using atmlab's arts_rslope_crossing, the function is OK-ed again.

	(plevel_crossing_2d): Added more asserts. Tested the new two step
	algorithm using atmlab's arts_rslope_crossing. Could not find any
	case where the algorithm fails (considering that the maximum
	radius distance for rslope_crossing now is (lat3-lat1)*c).

2012-02-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-1-3

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_step_geom_1d): Had to reinroduce handling of
	tangent points on this level. It was here for a good reason that I
	forgot (to also handle DOIT). Tangent points now flagged as endface
	8. Same change for 2D.

2012-02-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-2

	* src/libmicrohttpd/:

	Update to r19912 from https://gnunet.org/svn/libmicrohttpd.

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/libmicrohttpd/CMakeLists.txt:

	Tweak warning flags for Clang compiler, and libmicrohttpd.

2012-02-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-1

	* Merge arts-dev branch r7344 into trunk.

2012-02-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-0dev1

	* ChangeLog: Remove conflict marker.

2012-02-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-0dev0

	* Merged from trunk r7341.

2012-02-22  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-1-0

	* Increase minor version after branching.

2012-02-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-38dev4

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): lspace was not transfered to final
	ppath. Polishing of new code for 1D and 2D geomtric.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc: Ppath constant was saved as
	lspace!

2012-02-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-38dev3

	* make check and make check-fast now run with OK.

	* tests/*/*.arts:
	* includes/*/*.arts: All control files adopted to changes made
	around refellipsoid and ppath.

	* tests/testall.py (TestClearSky.test3): Changed target Tb for
	ClearSky case. This was needed as the Earth radius in constants.cc
	has been changed. Verified that old target Tb was obtained with
	old radius (so no change in RT part).

	Down-looking cases less affected by the changed radius, but could
	now be a slight shift with respect to old target values (if za <
	180).

2012-02-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-38dev2

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_copy): Did not work for l_step if ppath2.np=1.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): The case of single point ppaths now
	handled seperately when creating the final ppath. The merging of
	ppath_array could then be made somewhat more efficient, and solves
	a problem of getting nreal into the first point of final ppath.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometric): Now sets nreal to 1. This
	solves nreal for geometrical calculations (after the changes above).

2012-02-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-38dev1

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_calc): Added handling of Ppath.lspace and
	Ppath.nreal. lspace calculated, but nreal not yet set.

	* src/m_general.cc (Print):
	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc (xml_write_to_stream): Added
	handling of Ppath.lspace, and adopted to changed field order.

	* src/ppath.h (struct Ppath): Added field lspace. Needed to
	keep track of complte ppath length/delay. Changed order of fields.

	* src/ppath.cc (rslope_crossing): New function. Just performing
	core task of old plevel_crossing_2d (finding the crossing with a
	level having radial slope).

	(plevel_crossing_2d): New version of this function, with extended
	scope. It now handles all tasks around checking if there is a
	crossing inside the latitude grid range. The accuracy also
	improved, as the Taylor expansion expression is now only used for
	a final smaller step. Exact expressions are used in a first step,
	moving the ppath as close as possible to the surface before the
	approximative expression is applied.

	(do_gridcell_2dv2): New version of do_gridcell_2d, making use of
	the functions above. All this recoding done with the aim to later
	use the same calculation approach, and function structures, for 3D.

	* arts-2-0-30

	* Preparations for ARTSCAT-4.

	* src/absorption.{cc,h}:

	Rename LineRecord::Version to LineRecord::VersionString. Version() now

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppath_stepGeometric): Adopted calls of
	sub-functions. p_grid now not used.

	* src/doit.cc (ppath_step_in_cloudbox): Removed this function. Not
	used at all!

	* src/ppath.cc: Changes throughout the file with respect to tangent
	points. The ppath fields now not set. Tangent points now not
	handled as an "endface", but handled one level lower among the
	sub-functions (now at the level of do_gridrange_1d level).
	Requires less shuffling of data and cleaner code.

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCIPA): Lat and lon of tangent point now
	determined from ppath.pos.

	* src/m_general.cc: 
	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc: Adopted to change of Pppath.

2012-02-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev13

	* src/ppath.cc (plevel_crossing_3d): Renamed to r_crossing_3d as
	task of function has been changed. Header text described the
	original version.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Some improvements of the
	code for finding TOA entrance point for 2D.
	Complete new code for 3D. Not yet tested heavily.

2012-02-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev12

	* tests/Ppath: Start on a set of new test control files.

	* src/ppath.cc: Corrected errors in several headers.
	Corrected/changed text for several errors.
	
	(geompath_za_at_r): Sign of za was not kept if r==ppc! 

	(ppath_start_stepping): Code 2D now revised and using a new
	algorithm for finding entrance point at TOA.
	(Full 1D and 2D ppath calculations tested quite carefully.)

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc (cloudbox_checkedCalc): Polished error message.

	* src/geodetic.cc (geomtanpoint2d): New. Not yet complete.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): A complete revision of the
	function, to use same basic approach for 1D, 2D and 3D. And to add
	some missing parts (cloudbox in 2D, cloudbox reaching TOA ...).
	Code for 2D presently not complete.

	* src/geodetic.cc (poslos2cart): Now not calling sph2cart, to save
	some time (code instead copied and adopted).

	* src/geodetic.cc (geomtanpoint): New function. Calculates the
	geomtrical tangent altitude, also for non-spherical planets.

	* src/constants.cc: Changed EARTH_RADIUS from 6.378e6 to 6.3781e6,
	which seems to be the standard value.

	* src/math_funcs.cc (cross): A function for 3D cross product. 
	(unitl): New function. Normalises a vector.
	
2012-02-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	system made. 

	* src/ppath.cc: Functions listed below removed.
	(plevel_crossing_3d): Here y <-> z change needed.

	* src/geodetic.cc: cart2poslos, cart2sph, geompath_tanpos_3d,
	poslos2cart and sph2cart, now placed in this file. Cartesian y and
	z axes have changed place inside these functions, to follow a more
	standard cartesian coordinate system.

2012-02-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev8

	* Code now updated following changes around refellipsoid and
	sensor_pos/rte_los. Made basic tests, but no heavy testing. This
	will be done after ppath_start_stepping is finished.

	* src/m_general.cc (Print): Adopted printing for Ppath.

	* src/ppath.h: Removed field z from Ppath structure.

	* src/montecarlo.cc (mcPathTraceIPA): Adopted to change for
	rte_pos (now holding altitude, not radius). Seems to be only
	needed change for all MC code, with respect to this point.

	* src/m_doit.cc (CloudboxGetIncoming, CloudboxGetIncoming1DAtm):
	Removed refellipsoid as input, now not used.

	* src/m_doit.cc (doit_i_fieldUpdateSeq1DPP):
	* src/doit.cc (cloud_ppath_update1D_planeparallel): Removed not
	used input arguments ppath_step_agenda and refellipsoid. Adopted
	to changes of pos definition.

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Now fixed and tested for 3D.

2012-02-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev7

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Updated for 3D.

2012-02-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* src/ppath.cc: 2D geomtric cases revised. 1D and 2D geometric
	tested. Started on 3D.

	* src/geodetic.cc (refell2d): New function.

2012-02-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev5

	* Work in progress. Transfer from lap- to desktop. Does not compile!

	* src/ppath.cc: Being revised.

	* src/xml_io_compound_types.cc (xml_write_to_stream): ppath.z ->
	ppath.r.

	* src/ppath.h (struct Ppath): Field z renamed to r.

	* src/m_ppath.cc: File revised with respect to new WSV definitions.
	(VectorZtanToZa1D): Adopted to new definition of sensor_pos.
	(VectorZtanToZaRefr1D): As above.

	* tests/OdinSMR/TestOdinSMR.arts:
	* tests/OdinSMR/TestOdinSMR_119ghz.arts: Removed call of
	sensor_posAddRgeoid.

	* includes/general.arts: refellipsoid now set (instead of r_geoid).

2012-02-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev4

	* src/: r_geoid and the term geoid wiped out from the source code!
	Numerous changes to make the change to refellipsoid, affecting a
	high number of files.

	The code compiles, but no test calculations yet made.

	* src/m_surface.cc (r_geoidSpherical, r_geoidWGS84): Removed.

	* src/workspace.cc: r_geoid removed.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (rte_posAddRgeoid): Removed. Sensor position will
	be given as altitude above ellipsoid (future change).
	(sensor_posAddRgeoid): As above.

	* src/m_ppath.cc (ppathCalc): Now considers basics_checked and
	cloudbox_checked.

	* src/m_atmosphere.cc (basics_checkedCalc): The method now checks
	refellipsoid instead of r_geoid.

2012-02-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-28dev3

	* doc/uguide/concept.tex: Rewrote item point including "geoid".

	* doc/uguide/surface.tex: Revised, following the change from
	r_geoid to refellipsoid.

	* doc/uguide/atmosphere.tex: Revised up to Sec. 2.5, following
	changes made/planned. The view of 1D and 2D atmospheres slightly
	changed. For 1D, the sensor is now consider to be placed at
	lat/lon=0, and be looking North. For 2D, the plane is now "locked"
	to pass above the poles, and lat=0 is at the Equator (but no upper
	or lower limit as before). This definition is needed for 2D to
	have a relationship to the reference ellipsoid.

	* src/check_input.cc (chk_atm_grids): Changed back to demand that
	lat_grid and lon_grid are empty when not used. Variables like
	"lat_true" and "lon_true" will be introduced to geographically
	place 1D and 2D cases.

2012-02-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

2012-01-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-26

	* src/m_optproperties.cc:

	Make all preprocessor macros UPPERCASE. Otherwise the code gets
	horribly unreadable. If they appear just as normal variables it's
	very hard to guess that they're actually macros.

	Macros changed: PART_TYPE F_DATAGRID T_DATAGRID ZA_DATAGRID AA_DATAGRID
	PHA_MAT_DATA_RAW EXT_MAT_DATA_RAW ABS_VEC_DATA_RAW PND_LIMIT

2012-01-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-25

2011-12-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-24

	* src/arts_omp.cc (arts_omp_in_parallel):

	No more special treatment needed for Intel Compiler.

2011-11-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-23

	* CMakeLists.txt:

	Add an additional check right at the beginning to make sure that we
	never allow cmake to be called inside the source directory.

	NOTE: If you get an error after updating that you have to build
	arts outside the source tree although you are actually in a separate
	build directory, make sure that there is no file 'CMakeCache.txt' or
	directory 'CMakeFiles' in your toplevel arts source(!!) directory.

	* tests/testall.py: Fix path to arts for Xcode build.

	* src/docserver.cc (insert_breadcrumbs): Fix type of t, int -> size_t.

2011-11-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-22

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: More definitions around refractive
	index. Some consistency changes.

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: Planck function equation now uses symbol
	definitions throughout.

2011-11-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-21

	* doc/uguide/rte.tex: New symbol definitions used.

	* doc/uguide/symbol_defs.tex: Added definitions for Stokes elements
	I, Q, U and V, and speed.

2011-11-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-20dev0

	* Created development branch from trunk r7212.

2011-11-11  Gerrit Holl <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-20

	* src/m_abs_lookup.cc (abs_lookupCreate): Improve error message.

2011-11-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-19

	* src/ppath.cc (ppath_start_stepping): Now also "upward"
	observations are allowed when the sensor is above the model
	atmosphere. The idea is to allow the cloudbox to include TOA.

2011-11-05  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-18

	* src/cloudbox.cc:

	(IWCtopnd_MH97): for large IWC (obviously outside the original
	parameterization range) number densities in small particle mode got
	negative. now, if so, explicitly set to 0. though not specified by MH97,
	this should be fine, since even the small mode rather creates particles
	with Dm>100um, which should be covered by the large mode.

2011-11-05  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-17

	* src/cloudbox.cc:

	(IWCtopnd_MH97): bugfix. cases with all ice in <100um mode (lowT &
	small IWC) lead to NaN at >100um mode lead to all pnd set to 0. now
	producing proper pnd_field (relevant more for IR than MW, I guess).

	(chk_pndsum): bugfixed interface, where vol and density where swapped.
	modified pnd scaling correction - don't let pnd==0 slip through, when
	xwc!=0, so rather test for xwc==0 instead of x.sum()==0. potentially
	caused huge deviations that went uncatched...

	* src/cloudbox.cc: corresponding chk_pndsum interface adaption.


2011-11-02  Daniel Kreyling <daniel.kreyling@nict.go.jp>

	* arts 2-0-16

	* src/m_cloudbox.cc: (pnd_fieldSetup) Added new globally
	applicable particle size distribution for ice and snow particles,
	based on the work of A.J. Heymsfield (apparently not published
	yet). In ARTS terms the new PSD is called 'H11' and can be used
	for scattering calculations just like 'MH97'.

	* src/cloudbox.cc (pnd_H11): new function to evaluate the
	distribution at given scattering particle sizes
	(scale_H11): scaling the 'H11' PND values to total ice or snow
	massdensity.

	*src/methods.cc: updated doku for 'H11'

	*src/workspace.cc: updated doku for 'H11'


2011-10-27  Jana Mendrok <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-13

	* src/absorption.h (LineRecord): Updated doxygen documentation for
	this class. (Basically added information on the XML header and
	footer.) Triggered by Agnes asking about a description of the ARTS
	catalogue format.

2011-10-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-12

	* src/agendas.cc: Ooops, don't fix it if it ain't broken.

2011-10-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* arts-2-0-11

	* src/docserver.{cc,h}:

	Mark broken *LINKS* red.

	Add a 'Doc check' page that lists all broken links. Add link to this
	page in footer.

	(insert_breadcrumb_token, insert_breadcrumbs): Fix broken breadcrumbs.

	(description_add_links): Also search through GIn and GOut to determine
	if *LINK* target exists.

2011-09-14  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-7

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc(MCGeneral): Bugfix
	  - Move check for g==0 to outside if...else block checking for
	    different scenarios; this is problematic in any case.

	* src/montecarlo.cc(mcPathTraceGeneral): Bugfix
	  - Don't calculate log(exp(very_negative_number)), result might
	    become 0, causing problems later. Use the very_negative_number
		directly instead.

2011-09-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* arts-2-0-6

	* src/agendas.cc: Added sensor_response_agenda. 

	* src/m_rte.cc (yCalc2): A version of yCalc using

2011-09-08  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* arts-2-0-4

	* src/m_montecarlo.cc (MCGeneral): Bugfix
	  
	  - If the lowest layer has large extent and a thick cloud, g may be 0
	  due to underflow, but then I_i should be 0 as well.  Don't turn it
	  into nan for no reason!
