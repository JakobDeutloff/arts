# This file contains the Arts history. ALWAYS add a note to this file, no
# matter how small your change. Also, always update the running version
# number. Newest change log entries first!
#
# You can very easily add an entry with emacs by typing either
# M-x add-change-log-entry or C-x 4 a.
#
# Remark about version numbers: Arts has a 3 digit version number, like
# for example Arts 1.2.3. For user releases the third digit is zero.
# The first two digits are set in configure.in. Update these only when
# you cut a user release. In that case you also have to set the third
# digit to zero.  The third digit is set in src/version.cc. Always
# update this, no matter how small your change!
