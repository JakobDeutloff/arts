	* This file contains  SAB 14.03.2000.

	* arts-0.0.1.
	* .cvsignore files added everywhere.
	* Started this file, the Arts history. ALWAYS add a note to this
	file, no matter how small your change. Also, always update the
	running version number. Newest change log entries first!
	  
	You can very easily add an entry with emacs by typing either M-x
	add-change-log-entry or C-x 4 a.
	  
	Remark about version numbers: Arts has a 3 digit version number,
	like for example Arts 1.2.3. For user releases the third digit is
	zero.  The first two digits are set in configure.in. Update these
	only when you cut a user release. In that case you also have to
	set the third digit to zero.  The third digit is set in
	src/version.cc. Always update this, no matter how small your
	change!
