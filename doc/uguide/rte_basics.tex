This chapter introduces some basic radiative transfer nomenclature and
equations. The radiative transfer equation is here presented in quite general
terms, while special cases and solutions are discussed in later parts of the
document.



\section{Stokes dimensionality}
%==============================================================================
\label{sec:fm_defs:polarisation}

The full polarisation state of radiation can be described by the Stokes vector,
and is the formalism applied in ARTS. The vector can be defined in different
ways, but it has always four elements. The Stokes vector, \StoVec, is here
written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fm_defs:stokevec}
  \StoVec = \left[
  \begin{array}{c}
   \StoI\\ \StoQ \\ \StoU\\ \StoV
  \end{array}
  \right],
\end{equation}
where the first component (\StoI) is the full intensity of the
radiation, the second component (\StoQ) is the difference between
vertical and horizontal polarisation, the third component (\StoU) is the
difference for $\pm$45$^\circ$ polarisation and the last component
(\StoV) is the difference between left and right circular polarisation.
That is:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \StoI &=&   \Iv + \Ih = \Ipff + \Imff = \Ilhc + \Irhc, \\
  \StoQ &=&   \Iv - \Ih,                                 \\
  \StoU &=&   \Ipff - \Imff,                             \\
  \StoV &=&   \Ilhc - \Irhc,                             
\end{eqnarray}
where \Iv, \Ih, \Ipff, and \Imff\ are the intensity of the component linearly
polarised at the vertical, horizontal, +45\degree\ and -45\degree\ direction,
respectively, and \Irhc, and \Ilhc\ are the intensity for the right- and
left-hand circular components. Further details on polarisation and the
definition of the Stokes vector are found in \theory,
Section~\ref{T-sec:polarization}.

ARTS is a fully polarised forward model, but can be run with a smaller
number of Stokes components. The selection is made with the workspace
variable \wsvindex{stokes\_dim}. For example, gaseous absorption and
emission are in general unpolarised, and if not scattering has to be
considered it is sufficient to only include the first Stokes
components in the simulations. To include higher order Stokes
components results only, in this case, in slower calculations. The
general case is here denoted as \textindex{vector radiative transfer},
while \textindex{scalar radiative transfer} refers to the case when
only the first Stokes component is considered.
 


\section{The radiative transfer equation}
%==============================================================================
\label{sec:rteq}

The radiative transfer problem can only be expressed in general terms as a
differential equation. One version for vector radiative transfer is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:VRTE0}
  \frac {\DiffD\StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)}{\DiffD s} =
    -\ExtMat(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir) \StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir) +
    \VctStl{j}_e(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir) + \VctStl{j}_s(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir),  
\end{equation}
where \Frq\ is frequency, \PPos\ represents the atmospheric position, \PDir\ is
the propagation direction (at \PPos), $s$ is distance along \PDir, $\ExtMat$ is
the extinction matrix, $\VctStl{j}_e$ is the emission at the point
and $\VctStl{j}_s$ represents the scattering from other directions into the
propagation direction. 


\subsection{Main cases}
\label{sec:rteq:cases}
%
One of the general assumptions in ARTS is that local thermodynamic equilibrium
(LTE) can be assumed. If we for the moment assume that scattering can be
totally neglected, then Equation~\ref{eq:VRTE0} becomes
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:VRTE1}
  \frac{\DiffD\StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)}{\DiffD s} =
    \AbsMat(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)\left[ \VctStl{s}- \StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)
    \right],
\end{equation}
where $\AbsMat$ is denoted as the absorption matrix and \VctStl{s} can be seen
as the emission source vector, defined as
\begin{equation}
  \VctStl{s} = [B(\Frq,\PPos),0,0,0]^T,
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the Planck function, describing blackbody radiation. Cases where
Equation~\ref{eq:VRTE1} is valid, are in ARTS denoted as ``clear-sky''
radiative transfer (implying LTE if nothing else is stated). The discussion of
such radiative transfer calculations is continued in Section~\ref{sec:rte}. The
atmospheric quantities contributing to $\AbsMat$ already for clear-sky
conditions are denoted as ``absorbing species''.

Some additional conditions are required to put scattering into the picture. If
scattering is of incoherent and elastic nature, the extension of 
Equation~\ref{eq:VRTE1} is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:VRTE2}
  \frac {\DiffD\StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)}{\DiffD s} &=&
    -\ExtMat(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir) \StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir) +
    \AbsMat(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir)\VctStl{s} + \\ \nonumber
    &&+ \int_{4\pi} \DiffD\PDir' \PhaMat(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir,\PDir')
    \StoVec(\Frq,\PPos,\PDir'),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\PhaMat$ is the scattering (or phase) matrix. The aerosol, cloud or
precipitation objects that cause \PhaMat\ to deviate from zero (and contribute
to both \ExtMat\ and $\AbsMat$) are simply denoted as ``particles'', and the
solution of Equation~\ref{eq:VRTE2} is referred to as ``scattering
calculations''. ARTS includes several modules to handle scattering, introduced
in the last part of this document.

Equation~\ref{eq:VRTE2} is discussed thoroughly in \ref{T-sec:rte_theory} of
\theory. This including that for some conditions also the ``n2-law of
radiance'' must be considered to obtain completely exact results, see further
Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:unit}.



\subsection{Absorption, extinction and propagation matrices}
\label{sec:rteq:propmat}

Extinction is the combined attenuation due to absorption and scattering. For
practical reasons, the extinction between absorbing species and particles are
kept seperated. The total absorption matrix is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:absmattotal}
  \AbsMat = \aAbsMat{a} + \aAbsMat{p}, 
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $p$ refers to absorbing species and particles, respectively. The
total extinction matrix is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:extmattotal}
  \ExtMat = \aAbsMat{a} + \aExtMat{p}, 
\end{equation}
where \aExtMat{p} is the particle extinction matrix
($\aExtMat{a}=\aAbsMat{s}$).

In some case, \aAbsMat{a} can also contain effects of magneto-optical type. An
example of such an effect is Faraday rotation. A common feature of
magneto-optical effects is that they not affect the intensity (\StoI), but
change the polarisation state. To indicate that not just absorption is
included, \AbsMat\ is by some authors denoted as the propagation matrix. This
name is not used here, to follow a more common nomenclature. The possibility
that \AbsMat\ can contain magneto-optical terms is in ARTS taken as implicit.
Instead, the particle absorption (\aAbsMat{p}) and extinction (\aExtMat{p})
matrices are together denoted as the particle propagation matrices. 


\subsection{Emission and absorption vectors}
\label{sec:rteq:evec}

The fact that only the first element of \VctStl{s} is non-zero has the
consequence, that, in the case of LTE, the emission vector ($\VctStl{j}_e$) can
be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:evec}
  \VctStl{j}_e = B \AbsVec,
\end{equation}
where \AbsVec\ is denoted as the absorption vector, and equals the first column
of \AbsMat.


\subsection{Comments and related workspace variables}
\label{sec:rteq:wsv}
%
The equations above treat a single frequency and a single direction, at a
time, and can be said to describe monochromatic pencil beam radiative
transfer. For simplicity, the frequency and direction are left out from many of
the equations in this user guide. 
Some further information around the involved radiative quantities:
\begin{description}
\item[\StoVec] As workspace variable denoted as \wsvindex{iy}. The variable can
  hold \StoVec\ for a range of frequencies, but covers only radiative transfer
  along a single propagation path. Please note the distinction to \wsvindex{y},
  that holds radiances from several frequencies and pencil beams, possibly
  weighted with some instrument responses.
\item[\aAbsMat{a}] The corresponding workspace variable is
  \wsvindex{absmat\_clearsky}, obtained through
  \wsaindex{absmat\_clearsky\_agenda}.
\item[\aAbsMat{p} and \aExtMat{p}] are matched by \wsvindex{absmat\_particle}
  and \wsvindex{extmat\_particle} that are both output of
  \wsaindex{propmat\_particle\_agenda}.
\item[B] As workspace variable called \wsvindex{blackbody\_radiation}, and 
  obatined by \wsaindex{blackbody\_radiation\_agenda}.
\item[$\VctStl{j}_e$] is denoted as \wsvindex{emission\_vector}, and the
  corresponding agenda is \wsaindex{emission\_vector\_agenda}.
\item[\PhaMat] has no direct correspondance as workspace variable. This as the
  different scattering methods differ in how \PhaMat\ is most efficiently is
  represented. Instead the methods extract the needed information directly from
  the general variable \wsvindex{scat\_data\_raw} (that also holds the basic
  data for determining \aAbsMat{p} and \aExtMat{p}), by dedicated internal
  functions.
\end{description}
