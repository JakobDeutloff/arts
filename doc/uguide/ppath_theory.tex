\section{Some basic geometrical relationships for 1D and 2D}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:basicgeom}

This section gives some expressions to determine positions along a
propagation path when refraction is neglected. The expressions deal
only with propagation path inside a plane, where the latitude angle is
the angular distance from an arbitrary point. This means that the
expressions given here can be directly applied for 1D and 2D. Some of
the expression are also of interest for 3D. The ARTS method for making
the calculation of concern is given inside parenthesis above each
equation, if not stated explicitly. A part of a geometrical
propagation path is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ppath:1d2dgeom}.

The law of sines gives that the product must $\Rds\sin(\ZntAng)$ be
constant along the propagation path:
\begin{equation}
  p_c = \Rds\sin(\ZntAng)
  \label{eq:ppath:geomconst}
\end{equation}
where the absolute value is taken for 2D zenith angles as they can for
such cases be negative. The propagation path constant, $p_c$, is
determined by the position and line-of-sight of the sensor, a
calculation done by the function \funcindex{geometrical\_ppc}. The
constant equals also the radius of the tangent point of the path (that
is found along an imaginary prolongation of the path behind the sensor
if the viewing direction is upwards). The expressions below are based
on $p_c$ as the usage of a global constant for the path should
decrease the sensitivity to numerical inaccuracies. If the
calculations are based solely on the values for the neighboring
point, a numerical inaccuracy can accumulate when going from one point
to next. The propagation path constant is stored in the field
\shortcode{constant} of \wsvindex{ppath} and \wsvindex{ppath\_step}.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.65\textwidth}

  \begin{minipage}[c]{0.35\textwidth}
   \caption{The radius (\Rds) and zenith angle (\ZntAng) for two points along
     the propagation path, and the distance along the path ($\Delta\PpathLng$)
     and the latitude difference ($\Delta\Lat$) between these points.}
   \label{fig:ppath:1d2dgeom}
  \end{minipage}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}   

The relationship between the distance along the path for an
infinitesimal change in radius is here denoted as the
\textindex{geometrical factor}, $g$. If refraction is neglected, valid
expressions for the geometrical factor are
\begin{equation}
  g = \frac{\DiffD l}{\DiffD r} 
           = \frac{1}{\cos(\ZntAng)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\ZntAng)}}
                                            = \frac{\Rds}{\sqrt{\Rds^2-p_c^2}}
  \label{eq:ppath:g_geom}
\end{equation}
For the radiative transfer calculations, only the distance between the
points, $\Delta \PpathLng$, is of interest, but for the internal
propagation path calculations the length from the tangent point (real
or imaginary), \PpathLng, is used. By integrating
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:g_geom}, we get that
(\funcindex{geomppath\_l\_at\_r})
\begin{equation}
  \PpathLng(\Rds) = \sqrt{\Rds^2-p_c^2} 
  \label{eq:ppath:r2l}
\end{equation}
As refraction is here neglected, the tangent point, the point of
concern and the center of the coordinate system make up a right
triangle and Equation \ref{eq:ppath:r2l} corresponds to the
Pythagorean relation where $p_c$ is the radius of the tangent point.
The distance between two points ($\Delta \PpathLng$) is obtained by
taking the difference of Equation \ref{eq:ppath:r2l} for the two
radii.

The radius for a given \PpathLng\ is simply (\funcindex{geomppath\_r\_at\_l})
\begin{equation}
  \Rds(\PpathLng) = \sqrt{\PpathLng^2+p_c^2} 
  \label{eq:ppath:l2r}
\end{equation}
The radius for a given zenith angle is simply obtained by rearranging 
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:geomconst} (\funcindex{geomppath\_r\_at\_za})
\begin{equation}
  \Rds(\ZntAng) = \frac{p_c}{sin(\ZntAng)}
  \label{eq:ppath:za2r}
\end{equation}
The zenith angle for a given radius is (\funcindex{geomppath\_za\_at\_r})
\begin{equation}
  \ZntAng(\Rds) = \left\{
   \begin{array}{ll}
    180 - \sin^{-1}(p_c/\Rds) & 
                   \textrm{for}\quad 90\degree < \aZntAng{a} \leq 180\degree\\
    \sin^{-1}(p_c/\Rds) & 
                   \textrm{for}\quad 0\degree \leq \aZntAng{a} \leq 90\degree\\
    -\sin^{-1}(p_c/\Rds) & 
                   \textrm{for}\quad -90\degree \leq \aZntAng{a} < 0\degree\\
    \sin^{-1}(p_c/\Rds) - 180 & 
                  \textrm{for}\quad -180\degree \leq \aZntAng{a} < -90\degree\\
   \end{array}   \right.
  \label{eq:ppath:r2psi}
\end{equation}
where \aZntAng{a} is any zenith angle valid for the path on the same
side of the tangent point. For example, for a 1D case, the part of the
path between the tangent point and the sensor has zenith angles
$90\degree < \aZntAng{a} \leq 180\degree$.

The latitude for a point (\funcindex{geomppath\_lat\_at\_za}) is most 
easily determined by its zenith angle \\

\begin{equation}
  \Lat(\ZntAng) = \aLat{0} + \aZntAng{0} - \ZntAng
  \label{eq:ppath:za2lat}
\end{equation}
where \aZntAng{0} and \aLat{0} are the zenith angle and latitude of some 
other point of the path. Equation \ref{eq:ppath:za2lat} is based on the 
fact that the quantities \aZntAng{1}, \aZntAng{2} and $\Delta\Lat$
fulfill the relationship
\begin{equation}
  \Delta\Lat = \aZntAng{1} - \aZntAng{2},
  \label{eq:ppath:dlat}
\end{equation}
this independently of the sign of the zenith angles. The definitions
used here result in that the absolute value of the zenith angle always
decreases towards zero when following the path in the line-of-sight
direction, that is, when going away from the sensor. It should then be
remembered that the latitudes for 1D measures the angular distance to
the sensor, and for 2D a positive zenith angle means observation
towards higher latitudes.

The radius for a given latitude (\funcindex{geomppath\_r\_at\_lat})
is obtained by combining Equations \ref{eq:ppath:za2lat} and
\ref{eq:ppath:za2r}.



\section{Calculation of geometrical propagations paths}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:stepcalc}

This section describes the calculation of geometrical propagation
paths for different atmospheric dimensionalities. That is, the effect
of refraction is neglected. These calculations are performed by the
workspace method \builtindoc{ppath\_stepGeometric}. This method, as all
methods for propagation path steps, adjust automatically to the
atmospheric dimensionality, but the actual calculations are performed
a sub-function for each dimensionality.


\subsection{1D}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:1Dgeom}

The core function for this case is \funcindex{do\_gridrange\_1d}. The
lowest and highest radius value along the path step is first
determined. If the line-of-sight is upwards ($\|\ZntAng| \leq
90\degree$), then the start point of the step gives the lowest radius,
and the radius of the pressure surface above gives the highest value.
In the case of a downwards line-of-sight, the lowest radius is either
the tangent point, the pressure surface below or the surface. The
needed quantities to describe the propagation path between the two
found radii are calculated by the function
\funcindex{geompath\_from\_r1\_to\_r2}, that has the option to
introduce more points to fulfill a length criterion between the path
points. The mathematics of \shortcode{geompath\_from\_r1\_to\_r2} are
given by Equations \ref{eq:ppath:geomconst}--\ref{eq:ppath:za2lat}.


\subsection{2D}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:2Dgeom}

The definitions given in Sections \ref{sec:fm_defs:atmdim} results in
that for a 2D case the radius of a pressure surface varies linearly
from one point of the latitude grid to next. This is the main
additional problem to solve, compared to the 1D case.
Figure \ref{fig:ppath:psurf_crossing} gives a schematic description of
the problem at hand, which is handled by the internal function
\funcindex{psurface\_crossing\_2d}.

The law of sine gives the following relationship for the crossing
point:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sin\Theta_p}{\aRds{0}+c\Lat} = 
                                \frac{\sin(\pi-\Lat-\Theta_p)}{\aRds{p}}
\end{equation}
which can be re-written to

\begin{figure}
 \begin{minipage}[c]{0.45\textwidth}
 \includegraphics*[width=0.92\textwidth]{psurf_crossing}
 \end{minipage}%
 \begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\textwidth}
  \caption{Quantities used to describe how to find the crossing between a 
    geometrical propagation path and a tilted pressure surface. The
    angle \Lat\ is the angular distance from a reference point on the
    path. The problem at hand is to find \Lat\ for the crossing
    point. The radius of the pressure surface at $\Lat = 0$ is
    denoted as $r_0$. The tilt of the pressure surface is $c$.}
  \label{fig:ppath:psurf_crossing}
 \end{minipage}%
\end{figure}   

\begin{equation}
   \aRds{p} \sin(\Theta_p) = (\aRds{0}+c\Lat) 
           (\sin\Theta_p \cos\Lat + \cos\Theta_p \sin\Lat)
 \label{eq:ppath:psurf1}
\end{equation}
This equation has no analytical solution. A first step to find an
approximative solution is to note that \Lat\ will be limited to
relatively small values. For example, if it shall be possible for the
angular distance \Lat\ to reach the value of 3\degree, the vertical
spacing between the pressure surfaces must be about 8\,km, while it
normally is below 2\,km. For angles $\Lat \leq 3\degree$, the sine and
cosine terms can be replaced with the two first terms of their Taylor
expansions with a relative accuracy of $< 4\topowerten{-7}$. That is,
\begin{eqnarray}
  \cos \Lat & \approx & 1 - \Lat^2 / 2    \nonumber \\
  \sin \Lat & \approx & \Lat - \Lat^3 / 6 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:psurf1} becomes with these replacements a
polynomial equation of order 4:
\begin{eqnarray}
    0 & = & p_0 + p_1 \Lat + p_2 \Lat^2 + p_3 \Lat^3 + p_4 \Lat^4 \\
  p_0 & = & (\aRds{0}-\aRds{p}) \sin\Theta_p \nonumber \\ 
  p_1 & = & \aRds{0}\cos\Theta_p + c \sin\Theta_p \nonumber \\ 
  p_2 & = & -(\aRds{0}\sin\Theta_p)/2 + c\cos\Theta_p  \nonumber \\ 
  p_3 & = & -(\aRds{0}\cos\Theta_p)/6 - (c\sin\Theta_p)/2 \nonumber \\ 
  p_4 & = & -(c \cos\Theta_p)/6  \nonumber 
  \label{eq:ppath:psurf2}
\end{eqnarray}
This equation is solved numerically with the root finding algorithm
implemented in the function \funcindex{poly\_root\_solve}. Solutions of
interest shall not be imaginary.

    (solid lines), or the lower pressure surface (dashed lines), to

    cylinder segment is highly exaggerated compared to a real case.
    The relationship between vertical and horisontal size deviates
    also from normal real cases.  Typical values for the vertical
    extension is around 500\,m, while the horisontal length is
    normally $>$10\,km.}

Geometrical 2D propagation path steps are determined by
\funcindex{do\_gridcell\_2d}. This function uses
\shortcode{psurface\_crossing\_2d} to calculate the latitude distance
to a crossing of the pressure surface below and above the present path
point. If the closest crossing point with the pressure surfaces is
outside the latitude range of the grid cell, it is the crossing of the
path with the end latitude (in the viewing direction) that is of
interest (Figure \ref{fig:ppath:ex3}).



\subsection{3D}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:3Dgeom}

Geometrical 3D propagation path steps are determined by the function
\funcindex{do\_gridcell\_3d}. It was first tested to use different
analytical expressions to calculate the length between a point and
the crossing of some radius, latitude or longitude. However, the
expressions found include the trigonometric functions and the squaring
of radii, which resulted in a high sensitivity to the numerical
inaccuracy. It was found that the numerical problems made the created
algorithm impossible to use in practice.
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:rcoss3Db} below is a reminiscence of that work.
In addition, no simple solution to the problem of finding the crossing
with a tilted 3D pressure surface using the analytical expressions was
found.

   \IF{$(l_{out}-l_{in})$ smaller than specified accuracy}
    \STATE{set accuracy flag to true}
   \ELSE
    \STATE{$l_{end} = (l_{in}+l_{out})/2$}
   \ENDIF
  \ENDWHILE
  \STATE{$(\Rds,\Lat,\Lon)\gets(\Rds,\Lat,\Lon)+(\Rds_c,\Lat_c,\Lon_c)$}
 \end{algorithmic}
 \caption{The method applied in \shortcode{do\_gridcell\_3d} to find the 
          total length of the path step to be calculated.
          The symbol $S$ signifies here conversion from cartesian to
          spherical coordinates (Equation \ref{eq:ppath:cart2sph}).}
 \label{alg:ppath:dogridcell3d}
\end{algorithm}

A straightforward trail-and-error algorithm was then tested
(Algorithm \ref{alg:ppath:dogridcell3d} and
Figure \ref{fig:ppath:3Dsearch}). The main advantage of the algorithm
is that a correction for the shift in position caused by the
transformations back and fourth to a cartesian coordinate system can
be applied. The correction term assures that the position is not
changed for a step of zero length, and is not moved outside the grid
cell due to the numerical problems. The algorithm was further found to
be sufficiently fast to be accepted. A simple bisection search to find
the length of the propagation path step is used. Both the position and
the line-of-sight for the other end point of the path step are
calculated using a transformation to cartesian coordinates.  The
cartesian coordinate system used here is defined as:
\begin{description}
\item[x-axis] is along latitude 0\degree and longitude 0\degree
\item[y-axis] is along latitude +90\degree
\item[z-axis] is along latitude 0\degree and longitude +90\degree
\end{description}
This definition results in the following relationships between the
spherical $(\Rds,\Lat,\Lon)$ and cartesian $(x,y,z)$ coordinates
\begin{eqnarray}
  x &=& \Rds \cos(\Lat) \cos(\Lon) \nonumber \\
  y &=& \Rds \sin(\Lat)            \\
  z &=& \Rds \cos(\Lat) \sin(\Lon) \nonumber
 \label{eq:ppath:sph2cart}
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
 \label{eq:ppath:cart2sph}
  \Rds &=& \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}  \nonumber  \\
  \Lat &=& \arcsin(y/\Rds)                \\
  \Lon &=& \arctan(z/x) \qquad \mathrm{(implemented\ by\ the\ atan2\ function)}
                               \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The functions performing these transformations are \funcindex{sph2cart} and
\funcindex{cart2sph}.

    figure shows two iterations of the algorith to search for the

    final end points of the path step. The plus signs $(+)$ shows the
    position of the different lengths tested during the iterations.}

The first step to transform a line-of-sight, given by the zenith
($\ZntAng$) and the azimuth ($\AzmAng$) angle, to cartesian
coordinates is to determine the corresponding vector with unit length
in the spherical coordinate system:
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  \DiffD \Rds \\
  \DiffD \Lat \\
  \DiffD \Lon
 \end{array} \right] =
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
   \cos(\ZntAng) \\
   \sin(\ZntAng) \cos(\AzmAng) / \Rds \\
   \sin(\ZntAng) \sin(\AzmAng) / ( \Rds \cos(\Lat) )
 \end{array} \right]
 \label{eq:ppath:los2sphvec}
\end{equation}
This vector is then translated to the cartesian coordinate system as
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  \DiffD x \\
  \DiffD y \\
  \DiffD z
 \end{array} \right] =
 \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
  \cos(\Lat)\cos(\Lon) & -\Rds\sin(\Lat)\cos(\Lon) & 
                                                   -\Rds\cos(\Lat)\sin(\Lon) \\
  \sin(\Lat)           & \Rds\cos(\Lat)            & 0                     \\ 
  \cos(\Lat)\sin(\Lon) & -\Rds\sin(\Lat)\sin(\Lon) & \Rds\cos(\Lat)\cos(\Lon) 
 \end{array} \right] 
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  \DiffD \Rds \\
  \DiffD \Lat \\
  \DiffD \Lon
 \end{array} \right]
 \label{eq:ppath:los2cart}
\end{equation}
Note that the radial terms (\Rds) in Equations
\ref{eq:ppath:los2sphvec} and \ref{eq:ppath:los2cart} cancel each
other.  These calculations are performed in \funcindex{poslos2cart}.
Special expressions must be used for positions at the north and south
pole (see the code) as the azimuth angle has there a special
definition (Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:los}).

The cartesian position of a point along the geometrical path at a
distance $l$ is then simply
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  x_2 \\
  y_2 \\
  z_2
 \end{array} \right] =
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  x_1 + l\DiffD x \\
  y_1 + l\DiffD y \\
  z_1 + l\DiffD z
 \end{array} \right]
  \label{eq:ppath:xdl}
\end{equation}
The cartesian viewing vector $[\DiffD x, \DiffD y, \DiffD z]^T$ is
constant along a geometrical path. The new position is converted to
spherical coordinates by Equation \ref{eq:ppath:cart2sph} and the new
spherical viewing vector is calculated as
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  \DiffD \Rds \\
  \DiffD \Lat \\
  \DiffD \Lon
 \end{array} \right] =
 \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
  \cos(\Lat)\cos(\Lon) & \sin(\Lat)            & \cos(\Lat)\sin(\Lon) \\ 
  -\sin(\Lat)\cos(\Lon)/\Rds & \cos(\Lat)/\Rds & -\sin(\Lat)\sin(\Lon)/\Rds \\ 
  -\sin(\Lon)/(\Rds\cos(\Lat)) & 0             & \cos(\Lon)/(\Rds\cos(\Lat)) 
 \end{array} \right] 
 \left[ \begin{array}{c}
  \DiffD x \\
  \DiffD y \\
  \DiffD z
 \end{array} \right]
 \label{eq:ppath:los2sph}
\end{equation}
which is converted to a zenith and azimuth angle as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \ZntAng &=& \arccos(\DiffD \Rds) \nonumber  \\
  \AzmAng &=& \arccos(\Rds\DiffD\Lat/\sin(\ZntAng)), 
                      \qquad \textrm{for} \quad \DiffD\Lon >= 0 \\
  \AzmAng &=& -\arccos(\Rds\DiffD\Lat/\sin(\ZntAng)), 
                      \qquad \textrm{for} \quad \DiffD\Lon < 0  \nonumber
 \label{eq:ppath:conv2zaaa}
\end{eqnarray}
Special expressions must be used for positions at the north and south
pole (see the code) as the azimuth angle has there a special
definition (Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:los}). These calculations are performed in
\funcindex{cart2poslos}.

For sensor positions outside the atmosphere, the calculations made in
\funcindex{ppath\_start\_stepping} involve the problem of finding the
position where the path leaves the atmosphere. This position is found
by an iterative search. The maximum radius of the uppermost pressure
surface is taken as first guess for the radius of the exit point.  The
exit latitude and longitude for this radius is determined (as
discussed below), and the radius for the top of the atmosphere for the
found position is used as radius for next iteration. This procedure is
repeated until the change from one iteration to next for both latitude
and longitude is smaller than 1\topowerten{-6}. The exit position for
a given radius, \Rds, is found by solving the following equation
system:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Rds \cos(\Lat) \cos(\Lon)  & = & x+l\DiffD x \nonumber \\
  \Rds \sin(\Lat)             & = & y+l\DiffD y \\
  \Rds \cos(\Lat) \sin(\Lon)  & = & z+l\DiffD z \nonumber
  \label{eq:ppath:rcoss3Da}
\end{eqnarray}
where $(x,y,z)$ is the position of the sensor, $(\DiffD x,\DiffD
y,\DiffD z)$ the sensor LOS, and $l$, \Lat\ and \Lon\ are the variables
to be determined. The first step is to determine the distance $l$ to
the exit point, which is found by adding the square of all three
equations:
\begin{equation}
  \Rds^2 = (x+l\DiffD x)^2 + (y+l\DiffD y)^2 + (z+l\DiffD z)^2
  \label{eq:ppath:rcoss3Db}
\end{equation}
Once $l$ is determined, the latitude and longitude are easily
calculated by Equations \ref{eq:ppath:xdl} and
\ref{eq:ppath:cart2sph}. These calculations are implemented in the
function \funcindex{psurface\_crossing\_3d}.  Similar expressions were
derived to find the position for the crossing of a given latitude or
longitude but those expressions were removed from the code as they are
not used with present algorithms.\footnote{The expressions mentioned
  can be extracted from the function
  \shortcode{gridcell\_crossing\_3d} in ARTS version 1-1-440.}



\section{Refraction with simple Euler scheme}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:refreuler}

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics*[width=0.80\hsize]{ppath_refr1}
  \caption{Comparison of propagation paths calculated geometrically and 
    with refraction considered, for the same zenith angle of the
    sensor line-of-sight. The figure include two pair of paths, with
    refracted tangent altitude of about 0 and 10\,km, respectively.
    The horisontal coordinate is the latitude distance from the point
    where the path exits the model atmosphere (at 80\,km). The model
    atmosphere used had a spherical symmetry (that is, 1 D case, but
    the calculations were performed in 2D mode).}
  \label{fig:ppath:ppath_refr1}  
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
% This figure was produced by the Matlab function mkfigs_refraction

Refraction affects the radiative transfer in several ways. The
distance through a layer of a fixed vertical thickness will be
changed, and for a limb sounding observation the tangent point is
moved both vertically and horizontally. If the atmosphere is assumed
to be horizontally stratified (1D), a horizontal displacement is of no
importance but for 2D and 3D calculations this effect must be
considered. For limb sounding and a fixed zenith angle, the tangent
point is moved downwards compared to the pure geometrical case
(Figure \ref{fig:ppath:ppath_refr1}), resulting in that inclusion of
refraction in general gives higher intensities. However, the
propagation path is still symmetric around tangent and surface points.

The refraction causes a bending of the path, which gives a deviation
from the geometrical approximation of propagation along a straight
line. The bending of the path is obtained by the relationship
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\DiffD x}{\DiffD l} = \frac{1}{n} \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD y} \right)_x
  \label{eq:ppath:refrbend}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the direction of propagation, $l$ the distance along the
path, $n$ the refractive index\footnote{The refractive index is here
  assumed to have no imaginary part}, and $y$ is the coordinate
perpendicular to the path. See further Section 9.4 in
\citet{rodgers:00}.

The workspace method \wsmindex{ppath\_stepRefractionEuler} takes
refraction into consideration by probably the most simple (from the
viewpoint of implementation) algorithm possible. This does not mean
that it is the best way to consider refraction, it is rather
inefficient regarding computational burden, and if the step length for
the ray tracing (see below) is made very small, the result can be
completely wrong due to numerical problems.

The approach taken in \builtindoc{ppath\_stepRefractionEuler} is to
take a geometrical ray tracing step from the present point of the path
(and in the direction of present line-of-sight). Refraction is
considered only when the line-of-sight at the new point is determined
(Figure \ref{fig:ppath:euler}). The found line-of-sight is used to
calculate the next ray tracing step etc. This can be seen as an Euler
solution to the differential problem given by
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:refrbend}. The main difference between handling
1D, 2D or 3D cases is how the line-of-sight for the new point is
corrected to compensate for the bending due to refraction. The
calculation of propagation paths including the effect of refraction is
often denoted as \textindex{ray tracing}.

The length of the calculation steps is set by the generic input
\shortcode{lraytrace}. This length shall not be confused with the
final distance between the points that define the path, which is
controlled by the generic input \shortcode{lmax}. The path is first
determined in steps of \shortcode{lraytrace}. The found ray tracing
points are then used for an interpolation to create a path step
defined exactly as for geometrical calculations. The normal situation
is that the ray tracing step length is considerably shorter than the
final spacing between the path points. Suitable values for
\shortcode{lraytrace} have not yet been investigated in detail, but
for limb sounding values in around 1--10\,km should be appropriate.
Shorter ray tracing steps (down to a level where rounding errors will
start to have an impact) will of course give a propagation path more
accurately determined, but on the cost of more time consuming
calculations.

When determining the propagation path through the atmosphere
geometrical optics can be applied because the change of the refractive
index over a wavelength can be neglected. Applying Snell's law
to the geometry shown in Figure
\ref{fig:ppath:snell} gives
\begin{equation}
  n_i \sin (\aZntAng{i}) = n_{i+1} \sin (\aZntAng{i'})
\end{equation}
Using the same figure, the law of sines gives the relationship
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\sin(\aZntAng{i+1})}{\aRds{i}} = 
  \frac{\sin(180^\circ-\aZntAng{i+1}')}{\aRds{i+1}} =
  \frac{\sin(\aZntAng{i'})}{\aRds{i+1}} 
\end{equation}
By combining the two equations above, the Snell's law for a spherical
atmosphere (that is, 1D cases) is derived
\citep[e.g.][]{kyle:91,balluch:97}:
\begin{equation}
  p_c = \aRds{i} n_i \sin(\aZntAng{i}) = \aRds{i+1} n_{i+1}\sin(\aZntAng{i+1}) 
 \label{eq:ppath:snellspherical}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is a constant. With other words, the Snell's law for
spherical atmospheres states that the product of $n$, \Rds\ and
$\sin(\ZntAng)$ is constant along the propagation path. It is
noteworthy that with $n=1$, Equations \ref{eq:ppath:geomconst} and
\ref{eq:ppath:snellspherical} are identical.

The Snell's law for a spherical atmosphere makes it very easy to
determine the zenith angle of the path for a given radius. A
rearrangement of Equation \ref{eq:ppath:snellspherical} gives
\begin{equation}
  \ZntAng = \arcsin( \Rds n / p_c )
 \label{eq:ppath:za1D}
\end{equation}
This relationship makes it possible to handle refraction for 1D
without calculating any gradients of the refractive index, which is
needed for 2D and 3D. These calculations are implemented in the
function \funcindex{raytrace\_1d\_linear\_euler}.
Figure \ref{fig:ppath:N} shows the vertical variation of the
refractive index.





\subsection{2D}
\label{sec:ppath:refr2D}

\begin{figure}

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics*[width=0.7\hsize]{ppath_dndlat}
  \caption{Latitude gradient of the refractive index due to varying radius 
    of the geoid. The gradient is given as the change in refractive
    index over 1\,m, which allows direct comparison with the values in
    Figure \ref{fig:ppath:dndr}e. The wet atmosphere from
    Figure \ref{fig:ppath:dndr} was used for all latitudes, and the
    the plotted gradient is only caused by the fact that the radius of
    the geoid is not constant.  The gradient is positive on the
    southern hemisphere (shown), and negative on the northern
    hemisphere.}
  \label{fig:ppath:dndlat}  
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
% This figure was produced by the Matlab function mkfigs_refraction

Equation \ref{eq:ppath:refrbend} expressed in polar coordinates
is \citep[Eq. 9.30]{rodgers:00}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\DiffD(\Lat+\ZntAng)}{\DiffD l} = 
    -\frac{\sin\ZntAng}{n} \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Rds} \right)_\Lat
    +\frac{\cos\ZntAng}{n\Rds} \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lat} \right)_\Rds
  \label{eq:ppath:refrbend2d}
\end{equation}
If the gradients are zero (corresponding to the geometrical case) we
find that the sum of the zenith angle and the latitude is constant
along a 2D geometrical path, which is also made clear by
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:za2lat}. The geometrical zenith angle at ray
tracing point $i+1$ is accordingly $\aZntAng{i+1} = \aZntAng{i} -
(\aLat{i+1}-\aLat{i})$. If then also the refraction is considered, we
get the following expression:
\begin{equation}
  \aZntAng{i+1} = \aZntAng{i} - (\aLat{i+1}-\aLat{i}) + \frac{l_g}{n_i}
   \left[
    -\sin\aZntAng{i} \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Rds} \right)_{\aLat{i}}
    +\frac{\cos\aZntAng{i}}{\aRds{i}} 
                \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lat} \right)_{\aRds{i}}
  \right]  
  \label{eq:ppath:za2d}
\end{equation}
The gradients of the refractive index for 2D are calculated by the
function \funcindex{refr\_gradients\_2d}. This function returns the
gradients as the change of the refractive index over 1\,m. The
conversion for the latitude gradient corresponds to the $1/\Rds$ term
found in Equation \ref{eq:ppath:za2d}, and this term is accordingly
left out in \funcindex{raytrace\_2d\_linear\_euler}, which is the
function of this section. 

The radial and latitudinal gradients of the refractive index are
calculated in pure numerical way, by shifting the position slightly
from the position of concern. Figures \ref{fig:ppath:dndr} and
\ref{fig:ppath:dndlat} show example on gradients of the refractive
index.




\subsection{3D}
\label{sec:ppath:refr3D}
%----------------------
For 3D, the geomtrical expressions are used to
calculate the geometrical zenith and azimuth angles at the end of the
ray tracing step. Following the methodology for 2D, the geometrical
zenith and azimuth angles are then corrected to incorporate the
influence of refraction. The zenith angle is calculated as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \aZntAng{i+1} &=& \aZntAng{g} - \frac{l_g\sin\aZntAng{i}}{n_i} 
     \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Rds} \right)_{(\aLat{i},\aLon{i})} + \\
     & &  + \frac{l_g\cos\aZntAng{i}}{\aRds{i}n_i}
   \left[
     \cos\aAzmAng{i} 
          \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lat} \right)_{(\aRds{i},\aLon{i})}
    +\frac{\sin\aAzmAng{i}}{\cos\aLat{i}} 
          \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lon} \right)_{(\aRds{i},\aLat{i})}
  \right]  \nonumber
  \label{eq:ppath:za3d} 
\end{eqnarray}
where \aZntAng{g} is the zenith angle obtained from the geometrical
expressions. In similar manner, the geometrical azimuth angle,
\aAzmAng{g}, is corrected as
\begin{equation}
  \aAzmAng{i+1} = \aAzmAng{g} + \frac{l_g\sin\aZntAng{i}}{r_in_i} 
   \left[
    -\sin\aAzmAng{i} 
          \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lat} \right)_{(\aRds{i},\aLon{i})}
    +\frac{\cos\aAzmAng{i}}{\cos\aLat{i}}
          \left( \frac{\PartD n}{\PartD \Lon} \right)_{(\aRds{i},\aLat{i})}
  \right]  
  \label{eq:ppath:aa3d} 
\end{equation}
This expression, slightly modified, is found in
\funcindex{raytrace\_3d\_linear\_euler}. The terms of
Equation \ref{eq:ppath:aa3d} missing in that function, are part of
\funcindex{refr\_gradients\_3d} to convert the gradients to the same
unit. The longitude gradient is converted to the unit [1/m] by
multiplication with the term $1/(\Rds\cos\Lat)$.
