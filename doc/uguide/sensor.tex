% Introduction

 A sensor model is needed because a practical instrument gives consistently
 spectra deviating from the hypothetical monochromatic pencil beam spectra
 provided by the atmospheric part of the forward model. For a radio
 (heterodyne) instrument, the most influential sensor parts are the antenna,
 the mixer, the sideband filter and the spectrometer. The response (as a
 function of frequency, zenith angle \dots) of such instrument parts is here
 denoted as the sensor characteristics.

 The treatment of sensor variables is introduced in
 Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:sensor1}. As described in that section, the position
 and line-of-sight (\builtindoc{sensor\_pos} and \builtindoc{sensor\_los}) are
 treated separately, while remaining sensor characteristics are summarised by a
 ``response matrix'' denoted as \wsvindex{sensor\_response}. This matrix is
 applied following Equation~\ref{eq:fm_defs:measseq}. The purpose of this
 section is to describe how data on sensor characteristics are inputted to
 obtain a \builtindoc{sensor\_response} that matches your particular
 instrument.

 The implementation follows closely \citet{eriksson:06}. That article provides
 also a more careful description of the approach of applying a response matrix,
 and the equations used to convert different type of characteristics to
 response values. As a user of ARTS, the main practical issue is to understand
 the different file formats used for the different sensor parts. For the
 moment, this is only described mainly through the on-line documentation.


\section{General}
\label{sec:sensor:general}
%
In principle, a sensor must always be specified. However, if this shall be a
hypothetical sensor just providing the monochromatic pencil beam data coming
out of the atmospheric radiative transfer calculations, use
\wsmindex{sensorOff} (\builtindoc{sensor\_response} is in this case just an
identity matrix).

For other cases, the definition of the sensor characteristics is initiated by
calling \wsmindex{sensor\_responseInit}. The natural order to call the main
functions for the different sensor parts should be to follow the radiation
through the instrument. That is, the antenna should normally be the first part
to consider. If the order can be changed depends on the conditions. For
example, for a double side-band receiver the antenna must be considered before
the mixer, if the antenna response differs between the two bands. If the same
antenna response can be assumed for both bands, the same result is obtained
even if the mixer is introduced before the antenna.

Each response is defined for some grid. All responses are assumed to be zero
outside the range covered by the grid, even if the end values deviate from
zero. A positive aspect of this definition is that it is possible to define true
``rectangular'' responses. This is achieved by setting the end points of the
grid where the response drops to zero.

The sensor parts are normally associated with some loss of power, and sensor
contains also some amplification device. In general, it is not needed to
consider these aspects, as such effects are cancelled out by the calibration
process. The sensor should then be modelled as having no losses, which is
ensured by setting \wsvindex{sensor\_norm} to 1. The different responses are
then normalised in an appropriate manner. With \builtindoc{sensor\_norm} set to
0, all normalisation issues must be handled when defining the response files.


%\section{Antenna}
%\label{sec:sensor:antenna}

%The main function for including an antenna response is
%\wsmindex{sensor\_responseAntenna}, with the antenna characteristics described
%by \wsvindex{antenna\_response}. Other relevant workspace variables are 
%\wsvindex{antenna\_dim} and \wsvindex{antenna\_los}. Methods dedicated to set
%up \builtindoc{antenna\_response} are \wsmindex{antenna\_responseGaussian}
%and \wsmindex{AntennaConstantGaussian1D}.

%A real antenna response varies as a function of both zenith and azimuth angle,
%but the azimuth variation is frequently ignored. For 1D and 2D atmosphere there
%is no azimuth angle defined and
