\section{Pure transmission calculations}
%===================
\label{sec:transmission}

If only the attenuation of a signal is of concern (i.e.\ atmospheric and
surface emissions are neglected), Equation~\ref{eq:fm_defs:rte_step2} can be
applied for all Stokes elements. The initiation of the Stokes vector by the
radiative background must also be adopted. The standard choice for
\wsaindex{iy\_space\_agenda} should here be \wsmindex{MatrixUnitIntensity}
(instead of \builtindoc{MatrixCBR}). Otherwise the calculations are performed
exactly as for cases with emission (\builtindoc{blackbody\_radiation\_agenda}
can be left undefined).

Calculations of pure transmission type are performed by the method denoted as
\wsmindex{iyTransmissionStandard}.




\section{Radio calculations}

\subsection{Determining the propagation path}
%===================
\label{sec:radiolinks:ppath}

Use \wsmindex{ppathFromRtePos2}.


\subsection{Free space loss}
%===================
\label{sec:radiolinks:ppath}
The radiance law is not applicable for the signal from a point source.
According to \citet{ippolito:satco:08}, the signal intensity at a distance
\(s\), in free space, from a transmitting antenna, with a gain \(g_{t}\) is
defined as
\begin{equation}
 I(s)=\frac{p_{t}g_{t}}{4\pi s^{2}},
\end{equation}
where \(p_{t}\) is the transmitted power. The power \(p_{r}\) received by a
receiving antenna with an effective aperture \(A_{e}\) and gain \(g_{r}\)
located a distance \(s\) from the transmitting antenna is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsl}
p_{r}(s)=\frac{p_{t}g_{t}}{4\pi s^{2}}A_{e}=\frac{p_{t}g_{t}}{4\pi s^{2}}
\frac{g_{r}\Wvl^{2}}{4\pi}=
p_{t}g_{t}g_{r}\left(\frac{\Wvl}{4\pi s} \right)^{2},
\end{equation}
where the last term  
to the right (or actually the reciprocal) is denoted as the
free space path loss (\(F\)):
\begin{equation}
F\equiv\frac{p_{t}g_{t}g_{r}}{p_{r}}=\left(\frac{4\pi s}{\Wvl}\right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative of \(\Mpi(s)\) gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsplarts}
 \frac{\DiffD\Mpi(s)}{\DiffD s}=-\frac{2}{s}I(s).
\end{equation}
This equals the Beer-Lambert with an absorbance of $2/s$. With other words, the
free space loss can be treated as an ordinary extinction term. However, it
should be noted that this ``extinction coefficient'' is non-linear, it varies
with the distance from the transmitting antenna. 


\subsection{Extra path delay}
%
An electromagnetic wave that travels a path of given optical path 
length arrives with the same phase shift as if it had travelled a 
path of that physical length in a vacuum. 
In the absence of an atmosphere a signal
sent from a transmitter in the direction towards a receiver would
follow a straight line, i.e. the shortest geometric distance
between the two instruments. Moreover, the signal would propagate
with the speed of light.
The geometric distance \(D\) between the transmitter and receiver is
\begin{equation}
D\equiv\int_{straight\,line}1\DiffD s
\end{equation}
In the presence of an atmosphere, two changes follow,
the speed of the signal is retarded and the ray direction gets 
bent. 
The apparent bent ray-path length is
\begin{equation}
L\equiv\int_{bent\,ray-path}\Rfr(s)\DiffD s.
\end{equation}
One can also define the geometric bent ray-path length as
\begin{equation}
G\equiv\int_{bent\,ray-path}1\DiffD s.
\end{equation}
The total delay expressed in units of length is 
\begin{equation}
d \equiv L-D \ge 0,
\end{equation}
which can also be expressed as
\begin{equation} 
d=d_{a}+d_{g}=(L-G)+(G-D)
\end{equation}
where \(d_{a}\) is the along-path delay
and \(d_{g}\) is the geometric delay.
