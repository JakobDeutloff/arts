\section{Pure transmission calculations}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:transmission}

If only the attenuation of a signal is of concern (i.e.\ atmospheric and
surface emissions are neglected), Equation~\ref{eq:fm_defs:rte_step2} can be
applied for all Stokes elements. The initiation of the Stokes vector by the
radiative background must also be adopted. The standard choice for
\wsvindex{iy\_space\_agenda} should here be \wsmindex{MatrixUnitIntensity}
(instead of \builtindoc{MatrixCBR}). Otherwise the calculations are performed
exactly as for cases with emission (\builtindoc{emission\_agenda} can be left
undefined).

Calculations of pure transmission type are performed by the method denoted as
\wsmindex{iyBeerLambertStandardClearsky}. This method is complemented by
\wsmindex{iyBeerLambertStandardCloudbox}, to be applied inside the cloud box.
