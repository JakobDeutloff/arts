!! PE 001111 As I have introduced the Utility part in AUG, I suggest that each
utility gets its own chapter. In addition, I hope that AMI will grow and be worth a chapter of its own. When writting this I am sitting at home and cannot do
any cvs add and cvs remove, that's the reason to why I don't make the change myself directly. !!

This section describes utility programs and functions that are
distributed along with ARTS. This is most notably the interface to
Matlab and IDL.
