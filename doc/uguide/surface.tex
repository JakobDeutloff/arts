\section{The geoid}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:geoid}

The \textindex{geoid} is an imaginary surface used as a
reference when specifying the surface altitude and the altitude
of pressure levels. Any shape of the geoid is allowed but a smoothly
varying geoid is the natural choice, with the centers of the geoid and
the coordinate system coinciding. The geoid should normally be set to
the reference ellipsoid for some global geodetic datum, such as
WGS-84. For further reading on geoid ellipsoids and WGS-84, see
Section \ref{sec:ppath:geoid}.

Inside ARTS, the geoid is represented as a matrix (\wsvindex{r\_geoid}),
holding the geoid radius, \aRds{\odot}, for each crossing of the latitude and
longitude grids, $\aRds{\odot}=\aRds{\odot}(\Lat,\Lon)$. The geoid is not
defined outside the ranges covered by the latitude and longitude grids, with
the exception for 1D where the geoid by definition is a full sphere. The
surface altitude, \aAlt{g}, is given as the geometrical altitude above the
geoid. The radius for the surface is accordingly
\begin{equation}
  \aRds{g} = \aRds{\odot} + \aAlt{g}
 \label{eq:fm_defs:zsurface}
\end{equation}
As already mentioned, a gap between the surface and the 
lowermost pressure level is not allowed.

The ARTS variable for the \textindex{surface altitude}
(\wsvindex{z\_surface}) is a matrix of the same size as the geoid
matrix. For 1D, the surface is a sphere by definition (as the geoid),
while for 2D and 3D any shape is allowed and a rough model of the
surface topography can be made. The treatment of surface emission
and reflectivity is discussed in Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:surface}.

\section{Geoid ellipsoids and geodetic datums}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:geoids}

This section defines the geoid ellipsoid and discusses related
issues. The geoid is introduced in Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:geoid}.
The workspace variable representing the geoid is \wsvindex{r\_geoid}.


\subsection{Geoid ellipsoids}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:geoid}

All geodetic datums are based on a reference ellipsoid\index{geoid
  ellipsoid}. The ellipsoid is rotationally symmetric around the
north-south axis. That is, the ellipsoid radius has no longitude
variation, it is only a function of latitude. The ellipsoid is
described by an equatorial radius, \aRds{e}, and a polar radius,
\aRds{p}. These radii are indicated in Figure \ref{fig:ppath:lats}.
The radius of the ellipsoid for a given latitude is
\begin{equation}
 \aRds{\odot}(\Lat) = \sqrt{\frac{\aRds{e}^2\aRds{p}^2}
                    {\aRds{e}^2\sin^2\Lat+\aRds{p}^2\cos^2\Lat}}
 \label{eq:ppath:ellipsradius} 
\end{equation}
The radius given by Equation \ref{eq:ppath:ellipsradius} can be
directly applied for 2D and 3D cases. On the other hand, for 1D cases
the reference geoid is by definition a sphere and the radius of this
sphere shall be selected in such way that it represents the local
shape of a reference ellipsoid. This is achieved by setting
\aRds{\odot} to the radius of curvature of the ellipsoid. The
curvature radius differs from the local radius except at the equator
and an east-west direction. For example, at the equator and a
north-south direction, the curvature radius is smaller then the local
radius, while at the poles (for all directions) it is greater (see
further Figure \ref{fig:ppath:wgs84radii}). 

%The implications of
%approximating the geoid by the local curvature radius, instead of
%using a complete representation, is exemplified in
%Figure \ref{fig:ppath:wgs84_dz}.

The \textindex{curvature radius}, \aRds{c}, of an ellipsoid is 
\citep{rodgers:00}
\begin{equation}
 \aRds{c} = \frac{1}{\aRds{ns}^{-1}\cos^2 \Lat + \aRds{ew}^{-1}\sin^2 \Lat}
 \label{eq:ppath:curvradius} 
\end{equation}
where \aRds{ns} and \aRds{ew} are the north-south and east-west curvature radius, respectively,
\begin{eqnarray}
 \aRds{ns} &=& \aRds{e}^2\aRds{p}^2 (
           \aRds{e}^2\cos^2\AzmAng+\aRds{p}^2\sin^2\AzmAng )^{-\frac{3}{2}} \\
 \aRds{ew} &=& \aRds{e}^2 (
           \aRds{e}^2\cos^2\AzmAng+\aRds{p}^2\sin^2\AzmAng )^{-\frac{1}{2}} 
 \label{eq:ppath:rew} 
\end{eqnarray}
The azimuth angle, \AzmAng, is defined in
Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:los}. The latitude and azimuth angle to
apply in Equations \ref{eq:ppath:curvradius}--\ref{eq:ppath:rew}
shall rather be valid for a middle point of the propagation paths
(such as some tangent point), instead of the sensor position.

\subsection{Geocentric and geodetic latitudes}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:geolat}

The fact that the geoid is an ellipsoid, instead of a sphere, opens up
for the two different definitions of the latitude. The
\textindex{geocentric latitude}, which is the the one used here, is the
angle between the equatorial plane and the vector from the coordinate
system center to the position of concern. The \textindex{geodetic
  latitude} is also defined with respect to the equatorial plane, but
the angle to the normal to the reference ellipsoid is considered here, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:ppath:lats}. It could be mentioned that a
geocentric latitude does not depend on the geoid ellipsoid used, while
the geodetic latitudes change if another reference ellipsoid is
selected. An approximative relationship between the geodetic
($\Lat^*$) and geocentric (\Lat) latitudes is \citep{montenbruck:00}
\begin{equation}
 \Lat^* = \Lat + f\,\sin(2\Lat)  
 \label{eq:ppath:lats}
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the flattening of the ellipse:
\begin{equation}
 f = \frac{\aRds{e}-\aRds{p}}{\aRds{e}}
 \label{eq:ppath:flattening}
\end{equation}
The value of $f$ for the Earth is about 1/298.26. This means that the
largest differences between \Lat\ and $\Lat^*$ are found at
mid-latitudes and the maximum value is about 12 arc-minutes.

The \textindex{zenith} and \textindex{nadir} directions shall normally be
defined to follow the normal to the reference ellipsoid, but, if
nothing else is mentioned, these directions are here treated to go
along the vector the center of the coordinate system, as indicated in
Figure \ref{fig:ppath:lats}. This latter definition is preferred
as it results in that a propagation path in the zenith/nadir direction
can be described by a single latitude and longitude value. The
difference in geometrical altitude when using these two possible
definitions on the zenith direction is proportional to the deviation
between geocentric and geodetic latitude (Equation \ref{eq:ppath:lats}).
For an altitude of 100\,km around $\Lat=45\degree$, the difference is
about 350\,m.


\subsection{Geodetic datums}
%===================
\label{sec:ppath:geodatums}

Table \ref{tab:ppath:geodatums} gives the equatorial and polar radii
of the reference ellipsoid for the geodetic datums handled by ARTS.

\end{table}



\section{The dielectric constant and the refractive index}
 
 The properties of a material are reported either as the relative
 dielectric constant, $\epsilon$, or the refractive index, $n$. Both
 these quantities can be complex and are related as
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:surface_eps2n}
   n = \sqrt{\epsilon}.
 \end{equation}


\section{Relating reflectivity and emissivity}
 \label{sec:surface:surface:ref2emi}
 
 Kirchoff's law applied to thermodynamics states that under conditions
 of local thermodynamic equilibrium, thermal emission has to be equal
 to absorption \citep[page 215]{ulaby:81}. This is a consequence of
 the fact that there must exist a radiation equilibrium between an
 object and its surrounding, if it is surrounded by a blackbody having
 the same temperature (with no physical contact). 
 
 Thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed for natural surfaces, as
 long as there exist no strong temperature gradients. The Kirchoff law
 can then be used to relate the reflectivity and emissivity of a
 surface. For rough surfaces the scattering properties must be
 integrated over the half sphere (above the surface) to determine the
 emissivity \citep[see e.g.][Eq.\ 4.186]{ulaby:81}. For specular
 reflections (defined below) and scalar radiative transfer
 calculations, the emissivity $e$ is
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:e=1-r}
   e = 1 - r,
 \end{equation}
 where $r$ is the reflective (power reflection coefficient) of the
 surface.  Equation \ref{eq:e=1-r} is valid for each polarisation state
 individually \citep[Eq.\ 4.190a]{ulaby:81}.

 We have then that
 \begin{equation}
  \Mpi^\mathrm{up} = \Mpi^\mathrm{down}r + (1-r)B,
 \end{equation}
 where $\Mpi^\mathrm{up}$ is upwelling radiation, $\Mpi^\mathrm{down}$
 is downwelling radiation and $B$ is the magnitude of blackbody
 radiation. As expected, if $\Mpi^\mathrm{down}=B$, also
 $\Mpi^\mathrm{up}$ equals $B$.  Expressing the last observation using
 vector nomenclature gives
 \begin{equation}
   \left[\begin{array}{c} B \\ 0 \\0\\0 \end{array}\right] =
  \MtrStl{R} \left[\begin{array}{c} B \\ 0 \\0\\0 \end{array}\right] + 
  \VctStl{b},
 \end{equation}
 where $\MtrStl{R}$ is the matrix (4\,x\,4) correspondence to the
 scalar reflectivity, describing the properties of the surface
 reflection. The vector \VctStl{b} is the surface emission, that
 can be expressed as
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:bvector} 
  \VctStl{b} = (\MtrStl{1}-\MtrStl{R})
      \left[\begin{array}{c} B \\ 0 \\0\\0 \end{array}\right],
 \end{equation}
 where \MtrStl{1} is the identity matrix. 



\section{Main surface workspace variables}
\label{sec:surface:surface:wsvs}
%--------------
An introduction to the treatment of surface emission and reflections is given
in Section \ref{sec:fm_defs:surface}. As described in that section, the surface
properties are described by three workspace variables The methods developed to
handle different surface properties all set the variables
\wsvindex{surface\_emission}, \wsvindex{surface\_los} and
\wsvindex{surface\_rmatrix}.

Let us start with a simple (but unrealistic) example in order to explain the
usage of these workspace variables. We will here assume that all downwelling
radiation is reflected. This assumption is made for all polarisation states. We
assume further a 1D simulation, that the downwelling radiation shall be
calculated for nine zenith angles and that all downwelling directions
contribute equally (which is clearly not a realistic assumption!). The relevant
workspace variables should then be set as follows:
 
 \wsvindex{surface\_emission}: A matrix (of correct size) of zeros.

 \wsvindex{surface\_los}: A vector of length 9, covering the zenith
 angle range. A possible choice would be [5,15,25,\dots,85].

 \wsvindex{surface\_rmatrix}: Each reflection matrix is a diagonal
 matrix with the value 1/9 throughout on the diagonal. That is, all
 elements with index (:,:,i,i) is 1/9. Size matching
 \artsstyle{surface\_los}, \artsstyle{f\_grid} and
 \artsstyle{stokes\_dim}



\section{Specular reflections}
 \label{sec:surface:surface:specular}
 
 If the surface is sufficiently smooth, radiation will be
 reflected/scattered only in the complementary angle, specular
 reflection. Required smoothness for assuming specular reflection is
 normally estimated by the Rayleigh criterion:
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:surface:rayleigh}
   \Delta h < \frac{\Wvl}{8\cos\theta_1}
 \end{equation}
 where $\Delta h$ is the root mean square variation of the surface
 height, \Wvl\ the wavelength and $\theta_1$ the angle between the
 surface normal and the incident direction of the radiation. The
 criterion can also be defined with the factor 8 replaced with a 
 higher number.
 
 The complex reflection coefficient for the amplitude of the
 electromagnetic wave for vertical ($R_v$) and horizontal ($R_v$)
 polarisation is for a flat surface (if the relative magnetic
 permeability ($\mu_r$) of both media is 1) given by the Fresnel equations:
 \begin{eqnarray}
   \label{eq:surface_fresnel}
   R_v &=& \frac{n_2\cos\theta_1-n_1\cos\theta_2}
                                           {n_2\cos\theta_1+n_1\cos\theta_2} \\
   R_h &=& \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1-n_2\cos\theta_2}
                                           {n_1\cos\theta_1+n_2\cos\theta_2} 
 \end{eqnarray}
 where $n_1$ is refractive index for the medium where the reflected radiation
 is propagating, $\theta_1$ is the incident angle (measured from the local
 surface normal) and $n_2$ is the refractive index of the reflecting medium.
 The angle $\theta_2$ is the propagation direction for the transmitted part,
 and is (approximately) given by Snell's law:
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:surface:snell}
   \Re(n_1)\sin\theta_1 = \Re(n_2)\sin\theta_2,
 \end{equation}
 where $\Re(\cdot)$ denotes the real real part. Equation~\ref{eq:surface:snell}
 is theoretically correct only if both $n_1$ and $n_2$ have no imaginary part. 
 For cases where medium 1 is air, $n_1$ can (in this context) be set to 1, and 
an expression allowing $n_2$ to be complex is found in Section 5.4.1.3 of
\citet{liou:02}. We are not awere of any expression for the case when both
$n_1$ and $n_2$ are complex.

The power reflection coefficients are converted to an intensity
 reflection coefficient as
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:surface:R2r}
   r = |R|^2,
 \end{equation}
 where $|\!\cdot\!|$ denotes the absolute value. Note that $R$ can be
 complex, while $r$ is always real.

The surface reflection can be seen as a scattering event and
Section \ref{T-sec:polarization:ampmatrix} in \theory\ can be used to derive the
reflection matrix values. The scattering amplitude functions of
Equation \ref{T-eq:polarisation:ampmatrix1} in \theory\ are simply
\begin{eqnarray}
  S_2 &=& R_v, \\
  S_1 &=& R_h, \\
  S_3 = S_4 &=& =0.
\end{eqnarray}
This leads to that the transformation matrix for a specular surface
reflection is (compare to \citet[Sec.\ 5.4.3]{liou:02})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:specular_matrix}
  \MtrStl{R} =
     \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
       \frac{r_v+r_h}{2}&\frac{r_v-r_h}{2}&0&0\\
       \frac{r_v-r_h}{2}&\frac{r_v+r_h}{2}&0&0\\
    0&0&\frac{R_hR_v^\ast+R_vR_h^\ast}{2}&i\frac{R_hR_v^\ast-R_vR_h^\ast}{2}\\
    0&0&i\frac{R_vR_h^\ast-R_hR_v^\ast}{2}&\frac{R_hR_v^\ast+R_vR_h^\ast}{2}\\
     \end{array}
     \right].
\end{equation}
For the case of $R_v=R_h$ the matrix in
Equation~\ref{eq:surface:specular_matrix} is strictly diagonal and all the
diagonal elements have the same value, $(r_v+r_h)/2$.
have the same  
If the downwelling radiation is unpolarised, the reflected part of the
upwelling radiation is
\begin{equation}
  \MtrStl{R}
  \left[ \begin{array}{c} I\\0\\0\\0 \end{array} \right] =
  \left[ \begin{array}{c} I(r_v+r_h)/2\\I(r_v-r_h)/2\\0\\0 
  \end{array} \right].
\end{equation}
as expected.


If \MtrStl{R} is given by Equation \ref{eq:surface:specular_matrix},
Equation \ref{eq:surface:bvector} gives that the surface emission  is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:specular_emission}
   \VctStl{b} = \left[\begin{array}{c}
     B\left(1-\frac{r_v+r_h}{2}\right) \\
     B\frac{r_h-r_v}{2} \\
     0\\0
   \end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
In the case of specular reflections, \artsstyle{surface\_los} has the length 1.
The specular direction is calculated by the internal function
\funcindex{surface\_specular\_los}\footnote{Any tilt of the surface is
  neglected when determining the specular direction. If there would be any need
  to consider surface tilt, almost complete code for this task existed in
  \artsstyle{surface\_specular\_los} but was removed in version 1-1-876. The
  code can be obtained by e.g.\ checking out version 1-1-875.}. Equations
\ref{eq:surface:specular_matrix} and \ref{eq:surface:specular_emission} give
the values to put into \artsstyle{surface\_rmatrix} and
\artsstyle{surface\_emission}.



\section{Rough surfaces}
 \label{sec:surface:rough}


\subsection{Theory}
\label{sec:surface:rough:theory}
%---
The scattering of rough surfaces is normally described by the bidirectional
reflectance distribution function, BRDF. With the BRDF,
$f(\theta_0,\phi_0,\theta_1,\phi_1)$, the scattered radiance in the
direction $(\theta_1,\phi_1)$ can be written as (see e.g.\ 
\citet{rees:01} or \citet{petty:06})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:brdf1}
  I'(\theta_1,\phi_1) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^{2\pi} I(\theta,\phi) 
  \cos(\theta) f(\theta,\phi,\theta_1,\phi_1)
  \sin(\theta) \, \DiffD\phi \, \DiffD\theta,
\end{equation}
where $I(\theta,\phi)$ is the downwelling radiance for incidance angle $\theta$
and azimuth angle $\phi$. One important property of the BRDF is
\begin{equation}
  f(\theta_0,\phi_0,\theta_1,\phi_1) = f(\theta_1,\phi_1,\theta_0,\phi_0).
\end{equation}
The reflectivity is the half-sphere integral of the BRDF
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:brdf:r}
  r(\theta_1,\phi_1) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^{2\pi} 
  f(\theta_1,\phi_1,\theta,\phi) \cos(\theta)
  \sin(\theta) \, \DiffD\phi \, \DiffD\theta.
\end{equation}

If an angle in \artsstyle{surface\_los} gives the down-welling radiation
representing the directions defined by the ranges $[\theta_a,\theta_b]$ and
$[\phi_a,\phi_b]$, the value to put into the corresponding part of
\artsstyle{surface\_rmatrix} is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:brdf2}
  w = \int_{\theta_a}^{\theta_b} \! \int_{\phi_a}^{\phi_b} 
  \cos(\theta) f(\theta,\phi,\theta_1,\phi_1)
  \sin(\theta) \, \DiffD\phi \, \DiffD\theta.
\end{equation}
Thus, this value is a combination of the surface reflectivity and an solid
angle weight.


\subsection{Lambertian surface}
\label{sec:surface:rough:lambertian}
%---
An ideally rough surface is denoted as Lambertian. The BRDF is for this case
constant \citep[e.g.][]{petty:06}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:lambertian1}
  f = \frac{r_d}{\pi}
\end{equation}
where $r_d$ is the diffuse reflectivity. From Eq.~\ref{eq:surface:brdf:r} it 
follows that $r = r_d$.

The integral in Equation~\ref{eq:surface:brdf2} can here be solved. For the
case of $[\phi_a,\phi_b]$ = $[0,2\pi]$ we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:lambertian1}
  w = \frac{r_d}{2}\left[\cos(2\theta_a)-\cos(2\theta_b)\right].
\end{equation}
A second aspect of a Lambertian surface is that the reflected radiation is
unpolarised (thus indpendent of the polarisation of the downwelling radiation),
that is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:lambertian_matrix}
  \MtrStl{R} =
     \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
       w&0&0&0\\
       0&0&0&0\\
       0&0&0&0\\
       0&0&0&0\\
     \end{array}
     \right].
\end{equation}
The emission of a Lambertian surface is isotropic and unpolarised
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:surface:blambertian} 
  \VctStl{b} =  \left[\begin{array}{c} r_dB \\ 0 \\0\\0 \end{array}\right].
\end{equation}
