In many occasions you want to repeat the calculations with only a few
variables changed. Examples on such cases are to perform 1D
calculations for a number of atmospheric states taken from some
atmospheric model, generate a set of spectra to create a training
database for regression based inversions or perform a numeric
inversion error analysis. For such calculations it is inefficient to
perform the calculations by calling ARTS repeatedly. For example, as
data must be imported for each call even if the data are identical
between the cases. Cases such as the ones described above are here
denoted commonly as batch calculations.

It is impossible to put all possible types of batch calculations
inside a simple framework and the task of organising, or creating, the
input data is left to more flexible programming environments, such as
Matlab (where you of course use Atmlab) and Python. Instead, a general
core functionality has been created that is useful for a large range
of tasks. This functionality consists mainly of the three batch
agendas.


\section{Workspace variables and methods}
%
The calculation flow is controlled be setting the
\wsaindex{ybatch\_calc\_agenda}.
Beside this agenda, the user must set the variable
\wsvindex{ybatch\_n}. This variable is the number of defined batch
cases. Or in fact, how many batch cases that shall be considered. If
the agenda can provide more than \artsstyle{ybatch\_n} cases, the
remaining cases are just ignored. There are few formal requirements on
the involved agenda. Execution of \artsstyle{ybatch\_calc\_agenda}
must result in new spectrum vector, \artsstyle{y}, most likely by a
call of \artsstyle{RteCalc}.

The actual calculations are made by calling \wsmindex{ybatchCalc}. The
basic idea is simple, each loop inside this method shall
produce a new spectrum vector, where each realisation is stored in
\artsstyle{ybatch}. Variables are updated to a new batch case by
\artsstyle{ybatch\_calc\_agenda}, where \wsvindex{ybatch\_index}, set by
\artsstyle{ybatchCalc}, tells the agenda which case to select.
More in detail, \artsstyle{ybatchCalc} makes the following operations:\\
\indent 1. Performs a-c with \artsstyle{ybatch\_index} looped from 0 to (\artsstyle{ybatch\_n}-1)\\
\indent a. Executes \artsstyle{ybatch\_calc\_agenda}.\\
\indent b. If \artsstyle{ybatch\_index} = 0, resizes \artsstyle{ybatch} based
on \artsstyle{ybatch\_n} and length of \artsstyle{y} \\
\indent c. Makes copy of \artsstyle{y} in column \artsstyle{ybatch\_index} of \artsstyle{ybatch}.\\
You see it is simple! The question is only what to put inside the agenda?


\section{Control file examples}
%
There exist some special workspace methods for the
\artsstyle{ybatch\_calc\_agenda}, named as
\wsmindex{XxxxxExtractFromXxxxx}.  The common idea of these functions is to
store the batch cases in tensors with one dimension extra compared to
corresponding workspace variables. For example, a set of
\artsstyle{t\_field} (which is of type \artsstyle{Tensor3}) is stored
as \artsstyle{Tensor4}.

In the following 1D example, five atmospheric scenarios
have been put into the three first loaded files, and a random vector
of zenith angles is found in the last file. The batch calculations
are then performed as:

\begin{verbatim}
ReadXML  (tensor4_1) {"batch_t_field.xml"}
ReadXML  (tensor4_2) {"batch_z_field.xml"}
ReadXML  (tensor5_1) {"batch_vmr_field.xml"}
ReadXML  (tensor3_1) {"batch_za.xml" }
IndexSet (ybatch_n)  {5}

AgendaSet (ybatch_calc_agenda) {
  Print (ybatch_index) {0}
  Tensor3ExtractFromTensor4 (t_field,    tensor4_1, ybatch_index) {}
  Tensor3ExtractFromTensor4 (z_field,    tensor4_2, ybatch_index) {}
  Tensor4ExtractFromTensor5 (vmr_field,  tensor5_1, ybatch_index) {}
  MatrixExtractFromTensor3  (sensor_los, tensor3_1, ybatch_index) {}

  RteCalc {}
}

ybatchCalc {}
MatrixToTbByRJ (ybatch, ybatch) {}

WriteXML (ybatch) {"ybatch_run1.xml"}
\end{verbatim}

If you then want to repeat the calculations, for example with another
propagation path step length (e.g. 25\,km), it is sufficient to add
the lines:

\begin{verbatim}
AgendaSet (ppath_step_agenda) {
   ppath_stepGeometric {25e3}
}

ybatchCalc {}
MatrixToTbByRJ (ybatch, ybatch) {}

WriteXML (ybatch) {"ybatch_run2.xml"}
\end{verbatim}
