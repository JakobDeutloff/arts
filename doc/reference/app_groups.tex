ARTS knows the following workspace variable groups:
\input{auto_groups.tex}

\noindent
To get the same list from the ARTS online documentation, type

\begin{verbatim}
arts -g
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
In fact, the list above is created automatically from the online
documentation, so it should be exactly identical to the
\artsstyle{arts -g} output. 

A WSV group is just a special kind of data type (the allowed types for
WSVs). Look under `data types' in the index if you want to find
information on a particular group.
