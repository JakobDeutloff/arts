Key features
============


General
=======
- New format of scattering meta data (see online doc of scat_meta_single).

- Cleaner separation of scattering data of the different scattering species:
  scat_data and scat_meta now organized as ArrayOfArrayOfSingleScattering/MetaData
  with each high-level array element corresponding to one scattering species,
  each lower level array element corresponding to one scattering element.

- ScatteringParticlesSelect doesn't select on material anymore (governed by
  sorting scattering data into ArrayOfArray...). Size range selection changed to
  diameter based selection instead of radius based.

- massdensity_field diversified into scat_species_mass_density_field,
  scat_species_mass_flux_field, scat_species_number_density_field to allow for
  multi-moment schemes.

- Default input format for compact batch atmospheres changed from ArrayOfMatrix
  to ArrayOfGriddedField. Selection of fields from input data now purely on the
  basis of abs_species and scat_species definitions.

- Changed tagging mechanism of field_names in
  batch_atm_fields_compactFromArrayOfMatrix. Now absorption species and
  scattering species related fields have to be marked as such. Scattering
  species fields additionally require a tag to indicate the type of field (mass
  density, mass flux, number density).

- DoitInit required to be called before DoitGetIncoming.

- Doit's first guess field can now be initialized with a (precalculated)
  complete in-cloudbox field providing an alternative to deriving it from
  the clearsky fields.

- Create WSMs are not allowed to be called inside Agendas anymore. Avoids
  confusion because variables are always global indendent of where they are
  created.

- WSM DoitCloudboxFieldPut removed, not needed anymore.

- WSM doit_i_fieldSetFromPrecalc now takes a generic Tensor7
  (stored doit_i_field) instead of the removed WSV doit_i_field1D_spectrum.

- Polarisation index coding of left- and right hand circular polarisation
  changed. See on-line doc of sensor_pol for present coding. Before the wrong
  polarisation nwas obtained when using the sensor part to extract the V Stokes
  element.
