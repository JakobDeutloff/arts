Key features
============


General
=======
- new format of scattering meta data (see online doc of scat_meta_single)

- Cleaner separation of scattering data of the different scattering species:
  scat_data and scat_meta now organized as ArrayOfArrayOfSingleScattering/MetaData
  with each high-level array element corresponding to one scattering species,
  each lower level array element corresponding to one scattering element.

- ScatteringParticlesSelect doesn't select on material anymore (governed by
  sorting scattering data into ArrayOfArray...). Size range selection changed to
  diameter based selection instead of radius based.

- default input format for compact batch atmospheres changed from ArrayOfMatrix
  to ArrayOfGriddedField. Selection of fields from input data now purely on the
  basis of abs_species and scat_species definitions.

- DoitInit required to be called before DoitGetIncoming.

- Doit's first guess field now can be initialized with a (precalculated)
  complete in-cloudbox field instead of (or in addition to) deriving it from
  clearsky incoming radiation.

- *Create WSMs are not allowed to be called inside Agendas anymore. Avoids
  confusion because variables are always global indendent of where they are
  created.
