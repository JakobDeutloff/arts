SAB 17.01.2000 Change copyright to FSF.
SAB 29.01.2000 do not compile documentation as default (maybe put it
               on target doc)
SAB 30.01.2000 Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.

SAB 27.03.2000 Add an author field to MdRecord.
SAB 21.05.2000 There is still a bug in the parser: If the control file
               contains no line braek after the last method an error
               message is issued. Fix this some day.
SAB 09.06.2000 Clean up methods.cc and workspace.cc (move
               non-essential stuff elsewhere).
