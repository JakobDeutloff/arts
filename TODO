Make a WSV out of the epsilon that is GIN for doit_conv_flagAbs. And use this
in the iyInterpCloudboxField-methods to set a correct error. Note that epsilon
can be defined both in radiance and Tb. Probably best to remove
doit_conv_flagAbsTb and instead making a WSM to convert epsilon from Tb to
radiance (using the newly added rayjean function). 
As far as I understand, DOIT assumes that emission is always given
as W/m3/Hz/sr. The question is then if DOIT shall use emission_agenda, as there
is no flexibility in selecting the source term.

Maybe MC and DOIT could use some of the more general functions developed for
FOS and BL-scat. For example, mirror_los should be of general interest.
