SAB 2000-01-30: Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.
                (Do not give the -g flag to the compiler, set NDEBUG.)
SAB 2000-03-27: Add an author field to MdRecord?
SAB 2000-06-17: Change interpolation in absorption part to interpp.
SAB 2000-08-16: - Implement abs_tags and wf_tags, also
                  abs_tagsDefine and wf_tagsDefine.
                - Change absComp to return absorption matrices only for 
                  wf_tags
SAB 2000-08-21: Some ideas for absorption:
                - Method lines_per_tgAddMirrorLines
                  Adds mirror lines for those transitions for which
                  the calculation frequency would be inside the
                  cutoff. 
		  Requires the lineshapes and the frequency grid as
                  input. 
		  This would remove the need for a special
                  implementation of the VVW line shape, only
		  Lorentz-type lineshape would be needed.

                - Method lines_per_tgRemoveOutsideCutoff
		  Remove all lines which would not contribute anything
                  due to lineshape frequency cutoff. Saves unnecessary
                  calls to lineshape function, which would only return
                  0.
		  Needs lineshapes and frequency grid as input.

		- Should it be enforced that the frequency grid is
                  sorted? If not, this must be done by the above
                  methods. 

		- Make a method to set the lineshape functions. (All
                  the rest is already there!)

SAB 2000-08-21: Give a nice error message if control file does not
                exist! (At the moment it just says `abgebrochen')

AvE 2000-08-22: Check that partition funciton coefficients are valid, 
                some species are not defined, nevertheless a dummy
                partition function coefficient is given. check that 
                the returned value of the partition function (NOT
                the ratio) is larger than zero after calling.

AvE 04.09.2000: Agnes Perrin mentioned that the simple scheme to calculate
	       	partition functions at different temperature is accurate enough,
		so one should actually perfom an accuracy check.

		simple scheme: 

		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot(T)*(T'/T)**1.5 for non linear molecule  
		and
		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot)*(T'/T)   for a linear molecule

		This way might be more efficient timewise.

SAB 2000-09-13: Remove `1D' from WSV names.

SAB 2000-09-13: Change names of automatically generated files to _auto...

AvE 2000-09-27: There is optimization potential in the lineshape.cc file,
		read FIXME comments over there.

SAB 2000-10-05: Remove name of argument from generic methods
                (i.e., WriteToFile instead fo
                VectorWriteToFile). Internally, unique names have to
                be assigned to the specific functions for the
                different WSV types. Will make the program internally
                somewhat more complicated, but much more user
                friendly.

SAB 2000-10-05: Implement a mechanism for `meta-methods', i.e.,
                methods that can execute parts of the controlfile with
                changed parameters in a private copy of the
                workspace. 

SAB 2000-10-05: Implement sparse matrices and multiplication of sparse
                matrix with a sparse matrix, matrix, or vector.

SAB 2000-10-05: Change matrix/vector package from TNT to MTL. A new
                version of MTL with a much better user interface is
                expected. However we cannot be sure exactly when it
                will be available. 

SAB 2000-10-05: Implement sensor model by sparse matrix. (Needs sparse
                matrix first)

SAB 2000-10-05: Implement optimization algorithms. (Needs meta-methods
                first.) 

SAB 2000-10-05: Make a first release.

SAB 2000-10-05: Set up ARTS mailing list. (Oliver)

SAB 2000-10-05: Set up ARTS web page. (Oliver)

SAB 2000-10-05: Create IDL version of AMI. (Wolfram)

SAB 2000-10-05: Fix pdf version of Uguide. (Oliver)

PE  2000-11-02: Change some data types as follows:
                  Numeric       -> NUMERIC
                  size_t        -> INDEX
                  string        -> STRING
                  ARRAYofsizet  -> ARRAYofINDEX
                  ARRAYofstring -> ARRAYofSTRING
                  Los           -> LOS
                  OneTag        -> TAG
                  TagGroups     -> TAGS
                (What about the last suggestions. If a remember correctly, 
                 we don't have tag groups, only tags. Correct?)                
                Note that int shall be removed as workspace variable group
                and be replaced with INDEX.

                The basic idea is that all ARTS data types are typed with
                upper case letters (beside of in ARRAYofXXX). We should
                try to keep the number of such types low, partly beacause
                there should be IO functions for each type.

                The absorption part has several special data types (Line, 
                LineRecord, SpeciesRecord etc.). Can some of you (Axel?) 
                look into this and change name according to the rule above
                and fix IO functions (only binary). Are all those data types
                really needed?
