Is PTILTMAX needed (found in ppath.h)?

Fix bug for mc_antenna (azimuth distance varies with za)

Revise AUG with respect to cganges around ppath.
Remove r_geoid from code. And make sure that it is not mentioned in AUG.

Regarding Doppler: Update AUG Information in methods.cc correct?
Add Doppler shift also to emission/Planck?

Include tilt when checking cloudbox limit.

Revise surface tilt and calculation of specular direction.

Revise usage of sensor_response_agenda, and resolve yCalc/yCalc2.

Make function for HSE general and using lat_true. Update TestGbased.arts

Make a WSV out of the epsilon that is GIN for doit_conv_flagAbs. And use this
in the iyInterpCloudboxField-methods to set a correct error. Note that epsilon
can be defined both in radiance and Tb. Probably best to remove
doit_conv_flagAbsTb and instead making a WSM to convert epsilon from Tb to
radiance (using the newly added rayjean function). 
As far as I understand, DOIT assumes that emission is always given
as W/m3/Hz/sr. The question is then if DOIT shall use emission_agenda, as there
is no flexibility in selecting the source term.

Maybe MC and DOIT could use some of the more general functions developed for
FOS and BL-scat. For example, mirror_los should be of general interest.
