SAB 17.01.2000 Change copyright to FSF.
SAB 29.01.2000 do not compile documentation as default (maybe put it
               on target doc)
SAB 29.01.2000 Query replace NumMatrix and NumVector by Matrix and
               Vector? First check that this does not clash with TNT
               names. (Probably obsolete, since I use MATRIX/VECTOR
               after all.)
SAB 30.01.2000 Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.
               (Do not give the -g flag to the compiler, set NDEBUG.)
