SAB 2000-01-30: Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.
                (Do not give the -g flag to the compiler, set NDEBUG.)
SAB 2000-03-27: Add an author field to MdRecord?
SAB 2000-08-21: Some ideas for absorption:
                - Method lines_per_tgAddMirrorLines
                  Adds mirror lines for those transitions for which
                  the calculation frequency would be inside the
                  cutoff. 
		  Requires the lineshapes and the frequency grid as
                  input. 
		  This would remove the need for a special
                  implementation of the VVW line shape, only
		  Lorentz-type lineshape would be needed.

                - Method lines_per_tgRemoveOutsideCutoff
		  Remove all lines which would not contribute anything
                  due to lineshape frequency cutoff. Saves unnecessary
                  calls to lineshape function, which would only return
                  0.
		  Needs lineshapes and frequency grid as input.

		- Should it be enforced that the frequency grid is
                  sorted? If not, this must be done by the above
                  methods. 

		- Make a method to set the lineshape functions. (All
                  the rest is already there!)

AvE 2000-08-22: Check that partition funciton coefficients are valid, 
                some species are not defined, nevertheless a dummy
                partition function coefficient is given. check that 
                the returned value of the partition function (NOT
                the ratio) is larger than zero after calling.

AvE 04.09.2000: Agnes Perrin mentioned that the simple scheme to calculate
	       	partition functions at different temperature is accurate enough,
		so one should actually perfom an accuracy check.

		simple scheme: 

		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot(T)*(T'/T)**1.5 for non linear molecule  
		and
		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot)*(T'/T)   for a linear molecule

		This way might be more efficient timewise.

AvE 2000-09-27: There is optimization potential in the lineshape.cc file,
		read FIXME comments over there.

SAB 2000-10-05: Make a first release.

SAB 2000-10-05: Set up ARTS web page. (Oliver)

PE  2000-11-11: Write the workspace variables in alphabetical order to 
                wsv.txt.

SAB 2000-11-08: Send information about ARTS to Gerald Nedolua for
                destribution to NDSC.

SAB 2000-11-10: Adapt sample control file in user guide to new method
                and WSV names.  

AvE 2000-11-30: Check that assert does not have a negative impact on
                the calculation time if compilation flags avoid assert
                calls, this can be done in the lineshape.cc file,
                where assert is called for each lineshape function and
                lineshape normalization factor.

SAB 2000-12-04: Make WSV groups (groups.cc) and Token types (token.h,
                token.cc) consistent.

SAB 2000-12-04: 
Implement this method:
  md_data.push_back
    ( MdRecord
      ( NAME("raw_vmrs_1dReadFromFiles"),
  	DESCRIPTION(
	  "Read the individual VMR profile for each TAGS from the list of\n"
	  "files given as keyword parameters. One file name must be specified for\n"
	  "each TAGS. The name may include a path."
	  ),
	OUTPUT(   raw_vmrs_1d_         ),
	INPUT(    tag_groups_          ),
	GOUTPUT(                       ),
	GINPUT(                        ),
	KEYWORDS( "filenames"          ),
	TYPES(    ARRAY_string_t       )));

SAB 2000-12-13: Find a solution how to remove WSVs (as if they had not
                been created). Best would be a *general* method (which
                is more than generic, since it should work for *any*
                WSV type). Second best would be any other way to get
                rid of WSVs. Add the moment this is not possible at
                all. :-(


SAB 2001-01-05: More clearly separate between WS methods and other
                functions. Should be always clear from the docu
                header. WS methods should also be listed in a separate
                section of the doxygen docu.

SAB 2001-01-05: Write to MTL Siek about adding to vectors?

SAB 2001-03-12: Rename `resize' to `replace'.

SAB 2001-03-12: Implement `conglomerates', a mechanism of binding a
                couple of WSVs together. Based on this, implement more
                logical ASCII I/O formats.

AvE 2001-04-03: I just tried to run some calculations with arts and the 
                new hitran 2000 edition, and of course, ran into problems. 
                I did update arts a bit with the new hitran species, but 
		just had to find out that more has changed. For example 
		Hitran has now more H2O isotopes.
 
		Somebody has to update arts to the 2000 edition. 

SAB 2001-09-18: Thomas, please move cloud water vapor saturation
		adjustment out of AtmFromRaw1D as soon as possible. Make a standalone
		method out of this. Use only lowercase letters for keywords, to be
		consistent with other methods.

SAB 2001-09-18: Thomas, please rename seltags to seltgs. Tgs means
		"tag groups", not "tags". (Each element of seltgs is a tag group,
		consisting of one or more tags.)


PE 2001-09-19:  The standard extension for the atmospheric profiles is .am.
		This is a remainder from old days. The extension shall be .aa
		(ARTS ASCII). All atmospheric files in arts-data must be 
		renamed.

PE 2001-09-19:  All: WRITE GOOD AND DETAILED ON-LINE INFORMATION.

PE 2001-09-19:  All: The consistency of function input should be checked. 
                I will make some functions to faciliate this.

PE 2001-09-19:  All: remove old and outdated points from this file. 

PE 2001-09-19:  All: remove old pieces of code in the files that no longer
		is of any interest.

PE 2001-09-19:  There is a comment in src/Makefile.am that changes must also
		be done in doxygen/Makefile.am. Is this still valid?

PE 2001-09-19:  Remove 1d from WSV names. The 2d WSV are not used, or?
                Remove these if not used. 

OLE 2001-09-21: Make the HDF part optional. Let the configure script determine
                whether HDF is installed or not and depending on that include the
                binary methods. To make this more convient all HDF related functions
                should be moved into a separate source file.
