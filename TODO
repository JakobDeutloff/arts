SAB 2000-01-30: Turn off all debugging options with ./configure flag.
                (Do not give the -g flag to the compiler, set NDEBUG.)
SAB 2000-03-27: Add an author field to MdRecord?
SAB 2000-06-17: Change interpolation in absorption part to interpp.
SAB 2000-08-21: Some ideas for absorption:
                - Method lines_per_tgAddMirrorLines
                  Adds mirror lines for those transitions for which
                  the calculation frequency would be inside the
                  cutoff. 
		  Requires the lineshapes and the frequency grid as
                  input. 
		  This would remove the need for a special
                  implementation of the VVW line shape, only
		  Lorentz-type lineshape would be needed.

                - Method lines_per_tgRemoveOutsideCutoff
		  Remove all lines which would not contribute anything
                  due to lineshape frequency cutoff. Saves unnecessary
                  calls to lineshape function, which would only return
                  0.
		  Needs lineshapes and frequency grid as input.

		- Should it be enforced that the frequency grid is
                  sorted? If not, this must be done by the above
                  methods. 

		- Make a method to set the lineshape functions. (All
                  the rest is already there!)

AvE 2000-08-22: Check that partition funciton coefficients are valid, 
                some species are not defined, nevertheless a dummy
                partition function coefficient is given. check that 
                the returned value of the partition function (NOT
                the ratio) is larger than zero after calling.

AvE 04.09.2000: Agnes Perrin mentioned that the simple scheme to calculate
	       	partition functions at different temperature is accurate enough,
		so one should actually perfom an accuracy check.

		simple scheme: 

		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot(T)*(T'/T)**1.5 for non linear molecule  
		and
		Q_rot(T')=Q_rot)*(T'/T)   for a linear molecule

		This way might be more efficient timewise.

SAB 2000-09-13: Remove `1D' from WSV names.

SAB 2000-09-13: Change names of automatically generated files to _auto...

AvE 2000-09-27: There is optimization potential in the lineshape.cc file,
		read FIXME comments over there.

SAB 2000-10-05: Implement sensor model by sparse matrix. (Needs sparse
                matrix first)

SAB 2000-10-05: Make a first release.

SAB 2000-10-05: Set up ARTS web page. (Oliver)

PE  2000-11-02: Change some data types as follows:
                  Numeric       -> NUMERIC
                  size_t        -> INDEX
                  string        -> STRING
                  ARRAYofsizet  -> ARRAYofINDEX
                  ARRAYofstring -> ARRAYofSTRING
                  Los           -> LOS
                  OneTag        -> TAG
                  TagGroups     -> TAGS
                (What about the last suggestions. If a remember correctly, 
                 we don't have tag groups, only tags. Correct?)                
                Note that int shall be removed as workspace variable group
                and be replaced with INDEX.

                The basic idea is that all ARTS data types are typed with
                upper case letters (beside of in ARRAYofXXX). We should
                try to keep the number of such types low, partly beacause
                there should be IO functions for each type.

                The absorption part has several special data types (Line, 
                LineRecord, SpeciesRecord etc.). Can some of you (Axel?) 
                look into this and change name according to the rule above
                and fix IO functions (only binary). Are all those data types
                really needed? 

PE  2000-11-11: Write the workspace variables in alphabetical order to 
                wsv.txt.

SAB 2000-11-08: Send information about ARTS to Gerald Nedolua for
                destribution to NDSC.

SAB 2000-11-10: Adapt sample control file in user guide to new method
                and WSV names.  

AvE 2000-11-30: Check that assert does not have a negative impact on
                the calculation time if compilation flags avoid assert
                calls, this can be done in the lineshape.cc file,
                where assert is called for each lineshape function and
                lineshape normalization factor.

SAB 2000-12-04: Make WSV groups (groups.cc) and Token types (token.h,
                token.cc) consistent.

SAB 2000-12-04: 
Implement this method:
  md_data.push_back
    ( MdRecord
      ( NAME("raw_vmrs_1dReadFromFiles"),
  	DESCRIPTION(
	  "Read the individual VMR profile for each TAGS from the list of\n"
	  "files given as keyword parameters. One file name must be specified for\n"
	  "each TAGS. The name may include a path."
	  ),
	OUTPUT(   raw_vmrs_1d_         ),
	INPUT(    tag_groups_          ),
	GOUTPUT(                       ),
	GINPUT(                        ),
	KEYWORDS( "filenames"          ),
	TYPES(    ARRAY_string_t       )));

SAB 2000-12-13: Find a solution how to remove WSVs (as if they had not
                been created). Best would be a *general* method (which
                is more than generic, since it should work for *any*
                WSV type). Second best would be any other way to get
                rid of WSVs. Add the moment this is not possible at
                all. :-(

PE 2000-12-14:  Interpolation in m_abs is not done using the standard 
                function (interpp). (Oooops, it is also mentioned above, 
                15/12 PE).

PE 2000-12-14:  Do what is possible to make the absorption as fast as possible.

SAB 2001-01-05: More clearly separate between WS methods and other
                functions. Should be always clear from the docu
                header. WS methods should also be listed in a separate
                section of the doxygen docu.

SAB 2001-01-05: Write to MTL Siek about adding to vectors?

PE 2001-02-14:  Contact MTL about banded symmetric matrices.

SAB 2001-03-12: Rename `resize' to `replace'.

SAB 2001-03-12: Implement `conglomerates', a mechanism of binding a
                couple of WSVs together. Based on this, implement more
                logical ASCII I/O formats.

AvE 2001-04-03: I just tried to run some calculations with arts and the 
                new hitran 2000 edition, and of course, ran into problems. 
                I did update arts a bit with the new hitran species, but 
		just had to find out that more has changed. For example 
		Hitran has now more H2O isotopes.
 
		Somebody has to update arts to the 2000 edition.
