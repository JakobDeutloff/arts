Welcome to ARTS.

ARTS is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

If you use data generated by ARTS in a scientific
publication, then please mention this and cite the most
appropriate of the ARTS publications that are summarized on
http://www.sat.uni-bremen.de/arts/docs.php

For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.
For building and installation instructions please see the INSTALL file.

It is likely that you want to install ARTS under your home directory
as a normal user. In this case, if your homedirectory is /home/myself,
you should run the configure script like this:

./configure --prefix=/home/myself/local

This will install the executable to /home/myself/local/bin and the
documentation to /home/myself/local/artsdoc. Of course, you should
make sure that /home/myself/local/bin is in your $PATH.

If you do not specify a prefix in this manner, ARTS will be installed
to /usr/local. See INSTALL file for more details. For some reason,
using the `~' to specify the home directory seems not to work in the
configure option.

There are some ARTS specific configure options:

--with-numeric-type=ARG : ARG could be double or float. Double is the
default. At the moment, there is no guaranty that ARTS works correctly
with float.

--with-integer-type=ARG : ARG could be short, int, long or size_t. The
default is long. Again, ARTS could fail if you choose a non-default
type here.

--disable-disort : Don't compile the DISORT scattering module.

--enable-more-warnings : Makes gcc complain about everything.

--enable-debug : Debug mode is turned on by default. To compile
without debugging information call configure with --disable-debug.

--enable-maintainer-mode : Call this if you want to modify the sources
or documentation. This mode requires the following tools: doxygen,
latex, pdflatex.
