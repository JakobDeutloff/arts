This directory contains the Fortran code for the T-Matrix method.

The code has been developed by Michael Mishchenko at the NASA
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York. This research
was funded by the NASA Radiation Sciences Program.

tmd.pyarts.f has been adapted into a callable subroutine by Cory Davis.

Files included in this directory:

tmd.lp.f.orig   # Original double-precision T-matrix code for randomly
                # oriented nonspherical particles
tmd.lp.f        # Same as above but stripped example results to make it compile
                # Compiled into tmatrix_tmd to produce reference output.
tmd.pyarts.f    # Modified T-Matrix code from PyARTS. This file is used by ARTS
                # because the main program has been converted into a
                # subroutine that is callable from ARTS.
tmatrix_tmd.ref # Reference output of the original T-Matrix program.
                # Results of the ARTS WSM TMatrixTest and tmatrix_tmd should
                # be identical to this file.

tmd.par.f       # Parameter file
lpd.f           # LAPACK routines
